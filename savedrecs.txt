AB Education is in need of reform, and the development of the sciences of
   mind and brain are candidates to contribute to the renovation of
   thewaypeople are instructed and of the tools that mediate learning.
   Knowledge-and evidence-based approaches to education put forward the
   fact that educational systems are inadequate to provide an answer to the
   challenges of the 21st century and claim that education should be guided
   by scientific principles rather than by intuition and professional
   wisdom only (or, worst, by tradition). This is because sciences that are
   capable of shedding light into learning process have dramatically
   advanced during the last half-century and, still more meaningfully,
   during the last 20 years. The time has come for a new science of
   learning to rise, which is structured around cognitive and neuroscience,
   investigates topics that stem from educational problems, and rests on
   rigorous forms of in-laboratory and in-vivo evaluation.

   neuroethics; Neuroscience
ID NEUROETHICS; BIOETHICS; ETHICS; BRAIN; WILL
AB Clinical neuroethics and neuroskepticism are recent entrants to the
   vocabulary of neuroethics. Clinical neuroethics has been used to
   distinguish problems of clinical relevance arising from developments in
   brain science from problems arising in neuroscience research proper.
   Neuroskepticism has been proposed as a counterweight to claims about the
   value and likely implications of developments in neuroscience. These two
   emergent streams of thought intersect within the practice of neurology.
   Neurologists face many traditional problems in bioethics, like end of
   life care in the persistent vegetative state, determination of capacity
   in progressive dementia, and requests for assisted suicide in
   cognition-preserving neurodegenerative disease (like amyotrophic lateral
   sclerosis). Neurologists also look to be at the forefront of downstream
   clinical applications of neuroscience, like pharmacological enhancement
   of mental life. At the same time, the practice of neurology, concerned
   primarily with the structure, function, and treatment of the nervous
   system, has historically fostered a kind of skeptical attitude toward
   its own subject matter. Not all problems that appear primarily
   neurological are primarily neurological. This disciplinary skepticism is
   generally clinical in orientation and limited in scope. The rise of
   interest in clinical neuroethics and in neuroskepticsim generally
   suggests a possible broader application. The clinical skepticism of
   neurology provides impetus for thinking about the appropriate role for
   skepticism in clinical areas of neuroethics. After a brief review of
   neuroskepticism and clinical neuroethics, a taxonomy of clinical
   neuroskepticism is offered and reasons why a stronger rather than weaker
   form of clinical neuroskepticism is currently warranted.

AB Purpose of review
   Progress in neurosciences, increasing computational power, and ongoing
   miniaturization of micro-technological components enable both a better
   understanding of human brain functions and development of new diagnostic
   and therapeutic tools. Research and development as well as clinical
   application of devices designed for recording neural signals from the
   brain or stimulating brain areas respectively raise conceptual and
   ethical questions.
   Recent findings
   Ethical issues of stimulating devices are mainly discussed in the field
   of deep brain stimulation. The debate with respect to its use for
   Parkinson's disease focuses on patients' benefit and unintended
   consequences - sometimes framed as questions of identity and change of
   personality. As deep brain stimulation is currently tested for a broad
   variety of different diseases, including psychiatric disorders, minimal
   conscious state and Alzheimer's disease, recently increasing ethical
   attention is paid to issues of clinical research and clinical
   innovation. However, with respect to recording devices, specific
   implications for patients' autonomy and responsibility are at the core
   of the discussion.
   Summary
   Brain-hardware interfaces need continuing ethical discussion to realize
   their full beneficial potential and avoid the pitfalls of hasty
   application.

AB Treatment decisions for patients in the vegetative state often have to
   be based on the patient's best interests, if the patient's will is not
   known. Physicians are, however, highly uncertain what kind of treatment
   is in such a difficult situation the patient's best interests. This
   article presents new insights from neuroscience and shows how treatment
   decision making should proceed to reach an ethically justified decision.
   Pivotal elements are a careful diagnosis using validated behavioural
   scales, an informed judgment about the existence of awareness and
   sentience, and an early prognostic assessment. As new imaging techniques
   and treatment options are not yet clinical standard due to low evidence,
   the best interests have to be judged in the context of uncertainty. The
   leading question should be whether the preferred treatment goal can be
   achieved with a realistic probability and a justifiable
   benefit-harmratio. This has to be judged for the individual patient,
   considering his personality and communicating with the family members.
   There cannot be a general answer to the question of best interests in
   the vegetative state, but only an individual answer in shared
   responsibility and based on the particular features of a special case.

   Most of these challenges are heavily shaped by broader social context
   and institutional practices, which highlights the importance of

AB Use of prescription stimulants by normal healthy individuals to enhance
   cognition is said to be on the rise. Who is using these medications for
   cognitive enhancement, and how prevalent is this practice? Do
   prescription stimulants in fact enhance cognition for normal healthy
   people? We review the epidemiological and cognitive neuroscience
   literatures in search of answers to these questions. Epidemiological
   issues addressed include the prevalence of nonmedical stimulant use,
   user demographics, methods by which users obtain prescription
   stimulants, and motivations for use. Cognitive neuroscience issues
   addressed include the effects of prescription stimulants on learning and
   executive function, as well as the task and individual variables
   associated with these effects. Little is known about the prevalence of
   prescription stimulant use for cognitive enhancement outside of student
   populations. Among college students, estimates of use vary widely but,
   taken together, suggest that the practice is commonplace. The cognitive
   effects of stimulants on normal healthy people cannot yet be
   characterized definitively, despite the volume of research that has been
   carried out on these issues. Published evidence suggests that
   declarative memory can be improved by stimulants, with some evidence
   consistent with enhanced consolidation of memories. Effects on the
   executive functions of working memory and cognitive control are less
   reliable but have been found for at least some individuals on some
   tasks. In closing, we enumerate the many outstanding questions that
   remain to be addressed by future research and also identify obstacles
   facing this research.

AB We are unlikely to stop seeking pleasure, as this would prejudice our
   health and well-being. Yet many psychoactive substances providing
   pleasure are outlawed as illicit recreational drugs, despite the fact
   that only some of them are addictive to some people. Efforts to redress
   their prohibition, or to reform legislation so that penalties are
   proportionate to harm have largely failed. Yet, if choices over seeking
   pleasure are ethical insofar as they avoid harm to oneself or others,
   public health strategies should foster ethical choice by moving beyond
   current risk management practices embodied in the harm reduction
   movement. The neuroscience of pleasure has much to offer neuroethics and
   public health strategies. Distinguishing between 'wanting' and 'liking'
   fosters new understandings of addiction. These hold promise for
   directing the search for pharmacotherapies which prevent addiction and
   relapse or disrupt associated neuromechanisms. They could inform new
   research into creating lawful psychoactive substances which give us
   pleasure without provoking addiction. As the health and well being of
   human and other animals rests upon the experience of pleasure, this
   would be an ethical objective within public health strategy. Were
   ethical and neurobiological obstacles to ending addiction to be
   overcome, problems associated with excessive consumption, the lure of
   unlawful psychoactive substances and the paucity of lawful means to
   achieve pleasurable altered states would remain. Non-addictive designer
   drugs, which reliably provided lawful access to pleasures and altered
   states, would ameliorate these public health concerns insofar as they
   fostered citizens' informed, ethical choices according to a
   neurobiological taxonomy of pleasures.

AB Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been proposed as a potential treatment
   of drug addiction on the basis of its effects on drug
   self-administration in animals and on addictive behaviours in some
   humans treated with DBS for other psychiatric or neurological
   conditions. DBS is seen as a more reversible intervention than ablative
   neurosurgery but it is nonetheless a treatment that carries significant
   risks. A review of preclinical and clinical evidence for the use of DBS
   to treat addiction suggests that more animal research is required to
   establish the safety and efficacy of the technology and to identify
   optimal treatment parameters before investigating its use in addicted
   persons. Severely addicted persons who try and fail to achieve
   abstinence may, however, be desperate enough to undergo such an invasive
   treatment if they believe that it will cure their addiction. History
   shows that the desperation for a "cure" of addiction can lead to the use
   of risky medical procedures before they have been rigorously tested. In
   the event that DBS is used in the treatment of addiction, we provide
   minimum ethical requirements for clinical trials of its use in the
   treatment of addiction. These include: restrictions of trials to
   severely intractable cases of addiction; independent oversight to ensure
   that patients have the capacity to consent and give that consent on the
   basis of a realistic appreciation of the potential benefits and risks of
   DBS; and rigorous assessments of the effectiveness and safety of this
   treatment compared to the best available treatments for addiction.

AB Neuroscience has substantially advanced the understanding of how changes
   in brain biochemistry contribute to mechanisms of tolerance and physical
   dependence via exposure to addictive drugs. Many scientists and mental
   health advocates scaffold this emerging knowledge by adding the
   imprimatur of disease, arguing that conceptualizing addiction as a
   "brain disease" will reduce stigma amongst the folk. Promoting a brain
   disease concept is grounded in beneficent and utilitarian thinking: the
   language makes room for individuals living with addiction to receive the
   same level of compassion and access to healthcare services as
   individuals living with other medical diseases, and promotes enlightened
   social and legal policies. However such claims may yield unintended
   consequences by fostering discrimination commonly associated with
   pathology. Specifically, the language of neuroscience used to describe
   addiction may reduce attitudes such as blame and responsibility while
   inadvertently identifying addicted persons as neurobiological others. In
   this paper, we examine the merits and limitations of adopting the
   language of neuroscience to describe addiction. We argue that the
   reframing of addiction in the language of neuroscience provides benefits
   such as the creation of empowered biosocial communities, but also
   creates a new set of risks, as descriptive neuroscience concepts are
   inseparable from historical attitudes and intuitions towards addiction
   and addicted persons. In particular, placing emphasis on the diseased
   brain may foster unintended harm by paradoxically increasing social
   distance towards the vulnerable group the term is intended to benefit.

AB There is growing evidence that dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) used
   to treat Parkinson's Disease can cause compulsive behaviours and impulse
   control disorders (ICDs), such as pathological gambling, compulsive
   buying and hypersexuality. Like more familiar drug-based forms of
   addiction, these iatrogenic disorders can cause significant harm and
   distress for sufferers and their families. In some cases, people treated
   with DRT have lost their homes and businesses, or have been prosecuted
   for criminal sexual behaviours. In this article we first examine the
   evidence that these disorders are caused by DRT. If it is accepted that
   DRT cause compulsive or addictive behaviours in a significant minority
   of individuals, then the following ethical and clinical questions arise:
   Under what circumstances is it ethical to prescribe a medication that
   may induce harmful compulsive behaviours? Are individuals treated with
   DRT morally responsible and hence culpable for harmful or criminal
   behaviour related to their medication? We conclude with some
   observations of the relevance of DRT-induced ICDs for our understanding
   of addiction and identify some promising directions for future research
   and ethical analysis.

AB Background: The research community has a mandate to discover effective
   treatments for neurodegenerative disorders. The ethics landscape
   surrounding this mandate is in a constant state of flux, and ongoing
   challenges place ever greater demands on investigators to be accountable
   to the public and to answer questions about the implications of their
   work for health care, society, and policy.
   Methods: We surveyed US-based investigators involved in
   neurodegenerative diseases research about how they value ethics-related
   issues, what motivates them to give consideration to those issues, and
   the barriers to doing so. Using the NIH CRISP database we identified
   1,034 researchers with relevant, active grants and invited them to
   complete an online questionnaire. We received 193 responses. We used
   exploratory factor analysis to transform individual survey questions
   into a smaller set of factors, and linear regression to understand the
   effect of key variables of interest on the factor scores.
   Results: Ethics-related issues clustered into two groups: research
   ethics and external influences. Heads of research groups viewed issues
   of research ethics to be more important than the other respondents.
   Concern about external influences was related to overall interest in
   ethics. Motivators clustered into five groups: ensuring public
   understanding, external forces, requirements, values, and press and
   public. Heads of research groups were more motivated to ensure public
   understanding of research than the other respondents. Barriers clustered
   into four groups: lack of resources, administrative burden, relevance to
   the research, and lack of interest. Perceived lack of ethics resources
   was a particular barrier for investigators working in drug discovery.
   Conclusions: The data suggest that senior level neuroscientists working
   in the field of neurodegeneration (ND), and drug discovery specifically,
   are motivated to consider ethics issues related to their work, but the
   perceived lack of ethics resources thwarts their efforts. With bioethics
   centres at more than 50% of the institutions at which these respondents
   reside, the neuroscience and bioethics communities appear to be
   disconnected. Dedicated ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI)
   programs, such as those fully integrated into genetics and regenerative
   medicine, provide models for achieving meaningful partnerships not yet
   adequately realized for scholars and trainees interested in drug
   discovery for ND.

   one of the most significant fields of research in recent years.
   Brain-imaging methods are important tools for investigating the brain's
   structure and functions and for studying emotions, language and
   perception. Their application to the field of education has set an
   unprecedented milestone.
   Furthermore, the ethical problems that underlie behaviour modification,
   through neuroscience, demand profound reflection by neuroethics about
   what is substantive and essential in the human being. Such reflection is
   especially called for in the design stage of any research entailing
   manipulation aimed at yielding modifications in personal and collective
   behaviour.

AB Human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) informs the
   understanding of the neural basis of mental function and is a key domain
   of ethical enquiry. It raises questions about the practice and
   implications of research, and reflexively informs ethics through the
   empirical investigation of moral judgments. It is at the centre of
   debate surrounding the importance of neuroscience findings for concepts
   such as personhood and free will, and the extent of their practical
   consequences. Here, we map the landscape of fMRI and neuroethics, using
   citation analysis to uncover salient topics. We find that this landscape
   is sparsely populated: despite previous calls for debate, there are few
   articles that discuss both fMRI and ethical, legal, or social
   implications (ELSI), and even fewer direct citations between the two
   literatures. Recognizing that practical barriers exist to integrating
   ELSI discussion into the research literature, we argue nonetheless that
   the ethical challenges of fMRI, and controversy over its conceptual and
   practical implications, make this essential.

AB The article aims to present the outcome of the investigation of social
   representations of 20 university students on the use of methylphenidate
   to improve cognitive performance in healthy people. In this qualitative
   and exploratory research, 20 university students between 18 and 25 years
   from health and humanities courses were divided into 3 focus groups to
   discuss about Pharmacological Cognitive Enhancement. Data analysis
   revealed that these students had greater tolerance to methods that alter
   neurobiology in favor of the social ideal of improving the performance
   of people. However, respondents expressed great concern about this
   procedure intensifying injustices and inequalities between people,
   especially in societies where there are already significant social
   differences. Thus, although the subject is little studied in Brazil, the
   analysis of data from this research suggests that Pharmacological
   Cognitive Enhancement is an important and relevant topic. Not only
   because this practice is related to construction and maintenance of
   individuals' subjectivity in a society that prioritizes the improvement
   in cognitive performance, but also because of the risk that this
   practice interferes in matters of social justice and equality.

AB We examined whether different types of brain images affect readers'
   evaluations of scientific reports. Five different brain images were
   selected from the neuroscience literature: a whole brain, an inflated
   brain, a cross-sectional brain slice, a glass brain, and a topographic
   map. First, the images were subjectively rated by 31 nonexperts for
   qualities associated with realism and perceived complexity. Each of the
   five images was later presented alongside one of five fictitious
   neuroscience articles (image-text pairings counterbalanced), and a
   different group of 122 novices rated the accompanying articles for
   scientific reasoning. They also separately reported their familiarity
   with each image type. Brain images previously rated as more
   three-dimensional produced more positive evaluations of the articles
   with which they were presented. Perceived image complexity also showed a
   marginal nonlinear relationship with article credibility ratings. Our
   findings suggest that choice of image format matters when disseminating
   neuroscience research to the general public.

AB Mental health care providers increasingly confront challenges posed by
   the introduction of new neurotechnology into the clinic, but little is
   known about the impact of such capabilities on practice patterns and
   relationships with patients. To address this important gap, we sought
   providers' perspectives on the potential clinical translation of
   functional neuroimaging for prediction and diagnosis of mental illness.
   We conducted 32 semi-structured telephone interviews with mental health
   care providers representing psychiatry, psychology, family medicine, and
   allied mental health. Our results suggest that mental health providers
   have begun to re-conceptualize mental illness with a neuroscience gaze.
   They report an epistemic commitment to the value of a brain scan to
   provide a meaningful explanation of mental illness for their clients. If
   functional neuroimaging continues along its projected trajectory to
   translation, providers will ultimately have to negotiate its role in
   mental health. Their perspectives, therefore, enrich bioethical
   discourse surrounding neurotechnology and inform the translational
   pathway.

ID MINIMALLY CONSCIOUS STATE; DISORDERS
AB Walter Freeman, the self styled neurosurgeon, became famous (or
   infamous) for psychosurgery. The operation of frontal leucotomy swept
   through the world (with Freeman himself performing something like 18,000
   cases) but it has tainted the whole idea of psychosurgery down to the
   present era. Modes of psychosurgery such as Deep Brain Stimulation and
   other highly selective neurosurgical procedures for neurological and
   psychiatric conditions are in ever-increasing use in current practice.
   The new, more exciting techniques are based in a widely held
   philosophical position on the relationship between the mind, brain and
   soul, which is the key to ethical debates in this area. Psychosurgery
   has always posed questions of responsibility, personality, character,
   identity, spirit, relationship, integrity, and human flourishing and
   they do not go away when we enter the brave new world of neuroethics and
   Deep Brain Stimulation.

ID THERAPEUTIC MISCONCEPTION; CLINICAL-TRIALS
AB It has become evident that neuroimaging raises new normative questions
   that cannot be addressed adequately within the (in this regard
   unspecific) frameworks of existing research ethics. Questions that are
   especially troubling are, among others, provoked by incidental findings.
   Two questions are particularly intricate in view of incidental findings:
   (1) How can the research subject's right not to know be guaranteed? And
   (2) should a diagnostic check of scans by a neuroradiologist become an
   obligatory part of neuroscientific research protocols? The present paper
   examines these question against the background of two recent
   recommendations. The differentiation between "difference position" and
   "similarity position" serves as an analytic tool to further investigate
   the issue and to develop a distinct proposal for answering the
   questions.

AB Many neurodevelopmental disorders affect early brain development in ways
   that are still poorly understood; yet, these disorders can place an
   enormous toll on patients, families, and society as a whole and affect

   a pragmatic, evidence-based framework for engaging in empiric ethics
   inquiry for a large consortium of researchers in neurodevelopmental
   disorders and provide relevant case studies of pragmatic neuroethics.
   The 3 neurodevelopmental disorders that are at the focus of our
   research, cerebral palsy (CP), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and fetal
   alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), bring unique and intersecting
   challenges of translating ethically research into clinical care for
   children and neonates. We identify and discuss challenges related to
   health care delivery in CP; neonatal neurological decision making;

AB This paper explores the relationships that various applied ethics bear
   to each other, both in particular disciplines and more generally. The
   introductory section lays out the challenge of coming up with such an
   account and, drawing a parallel with the philosophy of science, offers
   that applied ethics may either be unified or disunified. The second
   section develops one simple account through which applied ethics are
   unified, vis-A -vis ethical theory. However, this is not taken to be a
   satisfying answer, for reasons explained. In the third section, specific
   applied ethics are explored: biomedical ethics; business ethics;
   environmental ethics; and neuroethics. These are chosen not to be
   comprehensive, but rather for their traditions or other illustrative
   purposes. The final section draws together the results of the preceding
   analysis and defends a disunity conception of applied ethics.

AB In recent years, interest in the integration and application of
   neuroscientific theories, concepts, findings and methods to the research
   discipline of consumer behavior has been increasing. The sub-discipline
   of consumer neuroscience that has resulted from that interest belongs to
   the innovative approach of neuroeconomics. Consumer neuroscience
   investigates problems of consumption and marketing through methods and
   findings from neuroscience. Conventional research in consumer behavior
   and marketing necessarily looked at the human organism as being a "black
   box" which cannot be assessed directly, or physiologically. This was a
   time when research mainly used theoretical constructs to interpret these
   bodily processes and resulting behavior. More recently, however, modern
   techniques and methods in neuroscience have facilitated a far more
   direct look into the "black box" of the organism as the basis for the
   sub-discipline of consumer neuroscience. Consumer neuroscience,
   therefore, can significantly benefit research in the field of consumer
   behavior, particularly in the attempt to better understand human
   behavior in decision-making processes. Although consumer neuroscience is
   a fledgling discipline, it constitutes a complementing advancement
   toward more comprehensive testing and expansion of theory. Against this
   background, the primary goal of the paper is to provide an overview of
   methods, findings, and implications of selected studies in consumer
   neuroscience. Furthermore, we integrate aspects of consumer policy and
   neuroethics, discussing the possible implications of these insights for
   consumer protection.

AB Many subjects cannot give fully informed consent to take part in
   research by virtue of age or mental capacity. However, it is
   unacceptable to deny these patients involvement in research by virtue of
   a lack of capacity to consent to such research. Further, this would
   hinder the advancement of medical science and technologies that might
   ultimately benefit these patients. Conversely, it is as unacceptable to
   discriminate against these patients and their condition as it is to
   exploit them or expose them to undue risk. Neuroscientific research
   raises a number of specific ethical issues in this patient population,
   in particular issues of consent, potential benefits of research,
   management of incidental findings and the assignment of appropriate
   controls. This paper examines the dilemmas that surround such ethical
   issues, and demonstrates that various procedures including informed
   consent, deferred consent and consent by proxy can be used to consent
   patients in both the standard medical and research arenas. Researchers,
   clinicians and regulatory authorities must work together to understand
   the benefits, limitations, risks and obligations of any research study
   involving these patients in order to advance medical care.

AB Neuroethics is a developing field, concerned with addressing present and
   future applied ethical issues brought about directly and indirectly by
   neuroscience advancements. One domain where neuroscience has begun to
   have far-reaching ethical implications is in the research and
   development of pharmaceutical cognitive enhancers. Though such drugs are
   typically developed to treat cognitive disabilities and improve the
   quality of life for patients with neuropsychiatric disorders and brain
   injury, research has found that such drugs can improve performance on
   cognitive tasks in healthy individuals. In line with such findings is
   the growing use of these drugs by students and others for
   cognitive-enhancing purposes. The present paper reviews some of the
   evidence in both neuropsychiatric and healthy individuals and discusses
   the implications such research can have for society.

AB Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for psychiatric indications is
   becoming increasingly safe and effective. As a result, the treatment of
   these conditions by neurosurgeons is becoming more widespread and a
   larger part of the functional neurosurgeons' practice. Given the
   troubled history of the field and its current renaissance, it is
   important to evaluate current practices, to serve as a baseline for
   future comparison, and to gauge changing cultural attitudes towards
   invasive neuromodulation. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to
   obtain a snapshot of the practice of the contemporary functional
   neurosurgeon engaged in psychiatric surgery. Current practices as well
   as attitudes towards the direction of the field and its future were also
   investigated. Methods: We designed an online survey and distributed it
   electronically to 299 functional neurosurgeons in North America
   identified by membership in the World Society for Stereotactic and
   Functional Neurosugery. Subsequent statistical and thematic analysis was
   performed on the data obtained. Results: Of 299 surveys sent out, 84
   were completed (28%). Fifty percent of functional neurosurgeons are
   currently engaged in some form of psychiatric surgery, with DBS for
   obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression accounting for most cases.
   Most surgeons see psychiatric surgery as a growing field, with
   multidisciplinary teams and a greater engagement with psychiatry
   necessary for the expansion of the field. Opinions differed
   substantially on hypothetical scenarios dealing with surgical cognitive
   enhancement, with some in favour of it, citing patient autonomy and
   choice, and others drawing a clear distinction between pathologic and
   non-pathologic states. Conclusions: Surgery for psychiatric indications
   is a growing field in the contemporary functional neurosurgeon's
   practice. Most neurosurgeons see the field continuing to grow and
   psychiatric surgery becoming a larger part of their daily practice, with
   the appropriate ethical and psychiatric oversight. Future editions of
   this survey and their results can be used to trace the development and
   growth of the field as technology and cultural attitudes continue to
   evolve. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Various kinds of normative judgments are an integral part of everyday
   life. We extended the scrutiny of social cognitive neuroscience into the
   domain of legal decisions, investigating two groups, lawyers and other
   academics, during moral and legal decision-making. While we found
   activation of brain areas comprising the so-called 'moral brain' in both
   conditions, there was stronger activation in the left dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex and middle temporal gyrus particularly when subjects
   made legal decisions, suggesting that these were made in respect to more
   explicit rules and demanded more complex semantic processing. Comparing
   both groups, our data show that behaviorally lawyers conceived
   themselves as emotionally less involved during normative decision-making
   in general. A group x condition interaction in the dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex suggests a modulation of normative decision-making by
   attention based on subjects' normative expertise.

AB Background
   Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used for neuropsychiatric
   disorders in clinical and research settings for almost 50 years now.
   Recent evidence demonstrates some efficacy in treating
   obsessive-compulsive disorder and major depression in patients
   refractory to other treatment modalities beyond single case reports.
   This has led to a considerable surge of clinical and commercial interest
   in DBS for psychiatric indications. Because of the high vulnerability of
   psychiatric patients, the lack of extensive short- and long-term data
   about effectiveness and the rapid spread of questionable indications
   this new field in psychiatry requires ethical criteria that can be
   applied to both research and clinical decision-making.
   Objective and Methods
   We here present an evidence-based systematic ethical analysis of
   psychiatric DBS using the criteria of beneficence, nonmaleficence, and
   autonomy.
   Results and Conclusions
   The proposed criteria are helpful in analyzing empirical evidence,
   informing research investigations and guiding clinical decision-making.
   This will prepare the ground for ethically justified, empirically
   comprehensive :DBS in this highly vulnerable population and allow
   stringent future societal discussions about its legitimation. (C) 2011

AB In recent years, attempts have increasingly been made to connect
   neuroscience and law. Scientists and lawyers are imagining and actively
   fostering the realization of futures in which neuroscience will play a
   prominent role in the activity of courts. In this article I take these
   debates as my empirical object. I trace the emergence of neurolegal
   discourse, explore its focus on free will and lie detection, and show
   how expectations about the potential role neuroscience might play in the
   law are being embedded in new research programs and funding streams. In
   so doing, I analyze the role of particular "sociotechnical imaginaries"
   in stimulating, directing and restricting neurolegal discourse and
   highlight the ways in which new visions of law, science and scientists
   are produced in the process. Sociotechnical imaginaries are shown to be
   salient in structuring anticipatory discourse, and represent a key
   target for social scientific intervention in such debates.

   that is, unexpected findings made during the research, and outside the
   scope of the research, which have potential health importance. One
   underappreciated risk of incidental findings is the potential loss of
   the research subject's insurability; or if a research subject fails to
   disclose incidental findings when applying for insurance, the insurance
   contract may be voidable by the insurer. In this article, we seek to
   explain the insurability risks associated with incidental findings and
   to make recommendations for how researchers and research ethics
   committees should address the issue of disclosure of these risks.

AB Neuroethics deals with the normative implications of advances and new
   technology of neuroscience. Some scholars argue that experiments on
   moral judgment might allow solutions to moral problems in the future or
   already nowadays. We discuss this research under the label of moral
   physiology to delineate this theoretical question from the normative
   implications of applied neurotechnology. After summarizing influential
   theories of the field we turn to a methodological and theoretical
   reflection concerning the way to investigate moral judgment
   experimentally, as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging, one of
   the leading methods of behavioural and cognitive neuroscience. We relate
   this to general challenges within neuroethics, philosophy, and a
   multi-disciplinary view on human morality. We argue that moral
   physiology may indeed yield normatively relevant findings but only under
   the assumption of certain normative stances which cannot be justified
   ultimately by neuroscience experiments.

   This paper consists of analyses on claims concerning unnaturalness of

   If neuro-enhancement is unnatural, is its unnaturalness morally
   noteworthy? Four possible senses of naturalness are analyzed:
   naturalness as normality, naturalness as suitability, naturalness as
   belonging, and naturalness as familiarity. None of these interpretations
   offers sufficient support for the view that neuro-enhancement is morally
   problematic because of its unnaturalness.

ID DETECTING DECEPTION; ROMANTIC LOVE; LIMITS
AB The widespread use and novel applications of brain imaging techniques
   seem to open the possibility of new threats to one's privacy. Being in a
   situation where we cannot control what information about ourselves is
   available to others could restrict the jobs we can get, the business we
   conduct, the way we are seen by strangers, and the way we relate to our
   friends and family. While researchers and practitioners should be
   cautious about the ways they use brain imaging data, we argue that brain
   reading does not violate privacy in any way different from the already
   established psychological methods to determine mental phenomena, such as
   whether someone suffers from color blindness or is clinically depressed.
   For brain reading to constitute a new threat, we claim it would have to
   be possible to easily gather information about a subject's mental states
   in accidental or malicious ways without the knowledge of the subject.
   Against this possibility, we note that brain imaging techniques require
   (i) the researchers to intentionally seek a specific type of mental
   state to the exclusion of information about other states, (ii) the
   active cooperation and participation of subjects, and (iii) a method of
   analysis that depends on the already established psychological tests.
   Hence, while there should be policies that specify when brain imaging
   can be used and how, these policies should be treated within a broader
   context of privacy issues in psychology rather than as a special case.

AB In the present moment of cultural and political transition, one question
   seems to become the center of most other societal and civilizational
   questions: will the basic self-perception of the human being change
   under the influence of the new "neurotechnologies" and its accompanying
   ideologies like "Human enhancement" and "Transhumanism"? And if yes,
   how? Applied consciousness research is currently one-sidedly understood
   as brain research, and it is carried out mainly by the Natural Sciences
   under the influence of the "Economic-Technological Complex" and its
   relatively narrow interests. With its paradigmatic materialism
   determining the cultural spread of its temporary findings, it is already
   modifying our imaginary about what a human being is, what its rational
   self-determination can be, and how a "good society" can work. What is at
   stake with the change related to the findings of the new "consciousness
   technologies" is not only the principal socio-philosophical status of
   the human "self' or "I", but also the related concepts of humanism, open
   societies, individualism and rationality. Thus, the new
   neurotechnologies and their "neurophilosophies" are currently in the
   process of profoundly influencing the very basics of our cultural
   self-understanding, grown over centuries. This article discusses some of
   the implications of this development within the greater picture of the
   current "global mindset change". (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Definition of the problem The article goes into the matter of subtle
   changes, which can be noticed by patients being treated by deep brain
   stimulation. Arguments Thereby it is looked on alterations of the
   patients' practical self-relation by taking recourse to the conception
   of narrative identity. This shall be done via detailed description and
   analysis of both the patients' perception of themselves and of their
   environment, i.e. through the example of technomorph metaphors used by
   the patients in their self-descriptions. Conclusion The goal to achieve
   is to work out the novelty and the specifics of neurotechnologies-beyond
   current examinations-regarding the patients' behaviour towards
   themselves. Concluding normative implications for an ethical evaluation
   of neurotechnological usage are shown basing on the analysis of the
   patients' narrations.

AB Object. Advances in the neurosciences are stirring debate regarding the
   ethical issues surrounding novel neurosurgical interventions. The
   application of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for treating refractory
   psychiatric disease, for instance, has introduced the prospect of
   altering disorders of mind and behavior and the potential for
   neuroenhancement. The attitudes of current and future providers of this
   technology and their position regarding its possible future applications
   are unknown. The authors sought to gauge the opinions of neurosurgical
   staff and trainees toward various uses of neuromodulation technology
   including psychosurgery and neuroenhancement.
   Methods. The authors conducted a qualitative study involving in-depth
   interviews with 47 neurosurgery staff, trainees, and other
   neuroclinicians at a quaternary care center.
   Results. Several general themes emerged from the interviews. These
   included universal support for psychosurgery given adequate informed
   consent and rigorous scientific methodology, as well as a relative
   consensus regarding the priority given to patient autonomy and the
   preservation of personal identity. Participants' attitudes toward the
   future use of DBS and other means of neuromodulation for cognitive
   enhancement and personality alteration revealed less agreement, although
   most participants felt that alteration of nonpathological traits is
   objectionable.
   Conclusions. There is support in the neurosurgical community for the
   surgical management of refractory psychiatric disease. The use of
   neuromodulation for the alteration of nonpathological traits is morally
   and ethically dubious when it is out of sync with the values of society
   at large. Both DBS and neuromodulation will have far-reaching and
   profound public health implications. (DOI: 10.3171/2010.5.JNS091896)

AB Over the past 60 years, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
   Disorders (DSM) has evolved from early efforts to collect statistical
   information to a modern compendium of mental disorders that can be
   reliably diagnosed, but have not been validated. Throughout this
   history, DSM architects have struggled with the seemingly fundamental,
   but complex question of how to define a mental disorder. Current
   proposals indicate that a spectrum model of mental illness will be
   embraced in DSM-5, prompting renewed concern and debate about
   pathologizing normal existence. While a spectrum view of mental illness
   may reflect biologic reality and help pave the path towards validated
   models of psychiatric disorder, diagnostic expansion does have important
   practical implications and could give rise to problems in clinical work
   and society at large, including the further sanctioning of a shift from
   psychiatric treatment to neuroenhancement. Debates about what should or
   should not be considered a mental illness in DSM-5 are likely to remain
   unresolved and, in the future, must be framed according to contextual
   utility. Diagnosis and thresholds of pathology are ultimately
   value-based so that careful analysis and perhaps even different
   definitions of disorder may be required to guide decision-making in
   research, clinical work, and public policy. (Journal of Psychiatric

AB Neurogenetics promises rich insights into how the mind works.
   Researchers investigating the range of topics from normal brain
   functioning to pathological states are increasingly looking to genetics
   for clues on human variability and disease etiology. Is it fair to
   assume this interest in neurogenetics is universal? How should
   researchers and clinicians approach ideas of consent to research or
   prediction of disease when a subject or patient understands the mind
   with concepts or language incompatible with neurogenetics? In this paper
   we consider how non-Western philosophies bring complexity to ideas of
   individual and community consent and confidentiality in the context of
   neurogenetics.

AB Ethics is a growing interest for neuroscientists, but rather than
   signifying a commitment to the protection of human subjects, care of
   animals, and public understanding to which the professional community is
   engaged in a fundamental way, interest has been consumed by
   administrative overhead and the mission creep of institutional ethics
   reviews. Faculty, trainees, and staff (n = 605) in North America whose
   work involves brain imaging and brain stimulation completed an online
   survey about ethics in their research. Using factor analysis and linear
   regression, we found significant effects for invasiveness of imaging
   technique, professional position, gender, and local presence of
   bioethics centers. We propose strategies for improving communication
   between the neuroscience community and ethics review boards,
   collaborations between neuroscientists and biomedical ethicists, and
   ethics training in graduate neuroscience programs to revitalize mutual
   goals and interests.

AB Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a clinically established procedure for
   treating severe motor symptoms in patients suffering from end-stage
   Parkinson's disease, dystonia and essential tremor. Currently, it is
   tested for further indications including psychiatric disorders like
   major depression and a variety of other diseases. However, ethical
   issues of DBS demand continuing discussion. Analysing neuroethical and
   clinical literature, five major topics concerning the ethics of DBS in
   clinical practice were identified: thorough examination and weighing of
   risks and benefits; selecting patients fairly; protecting the health of
   children in paediatric DBS; special issues concerning patients'
   autonomy; and the normative impact of quality of life measurements. In
   exploring DBS for further applications, additionally, issues of research
   ethics have to be considered. Of special importance in this context are
   questions such as what additional value is generated by the research,
   how to realise scientific validity, which patients should be included,
   and how to achieve an acceptable risk-benefit ratio. Patients' benefit
   is central for ethical evaluation. This criterion can outweigh very
   serious side-effects, and can make DBS appropriate even in paediatrics.
   Because standard test procedures evade central aspects of patients'
   benefits, measuring quality of life should be supplemented by open
   in-depth interviews to provide a more adequate picture of patients'
   post-surgical situation. To examine its entire therapeutic potential,
   further research in DBS is needed. Studies should be based on solid
   scientific hypotheses and proceed cautiously to benefit severely
   suffering patients without putting them to undue risks.

AB We studied the frequency and consequences of incidental neuroimaging
   findings in 400 otherwise healthy, nonacute pediatric headache patients
   through a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis. We excluded patients
   with currently recommended clinical criteria to consider diagnostic
   neuroimaging. We categorized neuroimaging results as normal, remarkable
   without clinical action, remarkable with clinical follow-up action, and
   abnormal. One hundred eighty-five of 400 patients (46%) had
   neuroimaging. Of these, 78.4% of neuroimaging studies were normal, and
   none was considered abnormal. Also, 21.5% had remarkable findings in the
   neuroradiology report. The frequency and types of all incidental
   findings were generally comparable to previous studies. One third of
   these patients received further consultation or neuroimaging because of
   incidental findings. In the evaluation of nonacute pediatric headache,
   overuse of neuroimaging leads to frequent discovery of incidental
   findings and increased testing. Individualized health care calls for
   physician-consumer discussions about current indications for
   neuroimaging, the general frequency of incidental findings, and
   potential difficulties in their interpretation.

AB Neuroimaging research is yielding reports of sex differences in the
   brain. Yet the likelihood of spurious findings of sex differences, the
   teething problems of new technology, the obscurity of the relation
   between brain structure and psychological function, and difficulties
   inferring mental states from neuroimaging data all require us to be
   considerably cautious in interpreting such results. Unfortunately, these
   issues are often overlooked in popular accounts. Together with a
   tendency for people to regard neuroscientific information as more
   scientific than behavioral data, and as indicative of male and female
   "nature," these issues point to the worrisome possibility of public
   misunderstanding of what contemporary neuroscience tells us about
   gender.

AB The term neuroenhancement refers to improvement in the cognitive,
   emotional and motivational functions of healthy individuals through,
   inter alia, the use of drugs. Of known interventions, psychopharmacology
   provides readily available options, such as methylphenidate and
   modafinil. Both drugs are presumed to be in widespread use as cognitive
   enhancers for non-medical reasons. Based on a systematic review and
   meta-analysis we show that expectations regarding the effectiveness of
   these drugs exceed their actual effects, as has been demonstrated in
   single- or double-blind randomised controlled trials. Only studies with
   sufficient extractable data were included in the statistical analyses.
   For methylphenidate an improvement of memory was found, but no
   consistent evidence for other enhancing effects was uncovered. Modafinil
   on the other hand, was found to improve attention for well-rested
   individuals, while maintaining wakefulness, memory and executive
   functions to a significantly higher degree in sleep deprived individuals
   than did a placebo. However, repeated doses of modafinil were unable to
   prevent deterioration of cognitive performance over a longer period of
   sleep deprivation though maintaining wakefulness and possibly even
   inducing overconfidence in a person's own cognitive performance. (C)

AB The theoretical basis of some deep brain stimulation (DBS) trials
   undertaken in the early years was the phenomenon of "brain stimulation
   reward (BSR)," which was first identified in rats. The animals appeared
   to be rewarded by pleasure caused by the stimulation of certain brain
   regions (reward system), such as the septal area. "Self-stimulation"
   experiments, in which rats were allowed to stimulate their own brain by
   pressing a freely accessible lever, they quickly learned lever pressing
   and sometimes continued to stimulate until they exhausted themselves.
   BSR was also observed with DBS of the septal area in humans. DBS trials
   in later years were undertaken on other theoretical bases, but
   unexpected BSR was sometimes induced by stimulation of some areas, such
   as the locus coeruleus complex. When BSR was induced, the subjects
   experienced feelings that were described as "cheerful," "alert," "good,"
   "well-being," "comfort," "relaxation," "joy," or "satisfaction." Since
   the DBS procedure is equivalent to a "self-stimulation" experiment, they
   could become "addicted to the stimulation itself' or "compulsive about
   the stimulation," and stimulate themselves "for the entire day," "at
   maximum amplitude" and, in some instances, "into convulsions." DBS of
   the reward system has recently been applied to alleviate anhedonia in
   patients with refractory major depression. Although this approach
   appears promising, there remains a difficult problem: who can adjust
   their feelings and reward-oriented behavior within the normal range?
   With a self-stimulation procedure, the BSR may become uncontrollable. To
   develop DBS to the level of a standard therapy for mental disorders, we
   need to discuss "Who has the right to control the mental condition?" and
   "Who makes decisions" on "How much control is appropriate?" in daily
   life.

AB Patients suffering from disorders of consciousness constitute a
   population that exists largely outside of the daily practice patterns of
   neurosurgeons. Historically, treatment has focused on nursing and
   custodial issues with limited neurosurgical intervention. Recently,
   however, deep brain stimulation has been explored to restore cognitive
   and physical function to patients in minimally conscious states. In this
   article, the authors characterize the physiological mechanisms for the
   use of deep brain stimulation in persistently vegetative and minimally
   conscious patients, review published cases and associated ethical
   concerns, and discuss future directions of this technology. (DOI:

AB Reimer (Neuroethics 2008) believes that how we use language to
   characterize psychopathy may affect our judgments of moral
   responsibility. If we say a psychopath has a disorder we may reduce
   their responsibility for moral failure. If we say a psychopath is merely
   different, we may not reduce their responsibility. Vincent (Neuroethics
   2008) argues that if this were the case, a diagnosis of disorder would
   be both necessary and sufficient to reduce the responsibility of some
   agent for moral failure. Vincent presents two examples to suggest that a
   disorder is neither necessary nor sufficient to exculpate an individual
   for moral failure: childhood and hypomania. Vincent suggests instead
   that our judgments of moral responsibility ought to be based on the
   individual's capacity for moral agency. I will side with Vincent in this
   debate, but argue that the example she uses, hypomania, does not work. I
   will argue that a diagnosis of hypomania, part of Bipolar II Disorder,
   is sufficient to exculpate an individual for some moral failure. This is
   because there are responsibility-relevant capacities missing: the
   capacities for self-awareness and to control ones abilities. Without
   these capacities, the individual is not a responsible moral agent.
   Vincent will need to provide an alternative example to show that the
   presence of a disorder is not sufficient to exculpate an individual for
   moral failure. Whilst our use of language is important, that use
   reflects our judgments of the individual's capacities for moral agency.
   Responsibilities are determined not only by capacities, but by the right
   kind of capacities, and this should be reflected in our moral judgments,
   and our use of language.

AB A pressing issue in neuroscience is the high rate of misdiagnosis of
   disorders of consciousness. As new research on patients with disorders
   of consciousness has revealed surprising and previously unknown
   cognitive capacities, the need to develop better and more reliable
   methods of diagnosing these disorders becomes more urgent. So too the
   need to expand our ethical and social frameworks for thinking about
   these patients, to accommodate new concerns that will accompany new
   revelations. A recent study on trace conditioning and learning in
   vegetative and minimally conscious patients shows promise as a potential
   diagnostic and prognostic tool, both for differentiating between states
   of diminished consciousness, and for predicting patient outcomes, but it
   also generates fresh concerns about quality of life in patients
   previously thought to be completely unaware. Optimism about progress in
   diagnosing and treating disorders of consciousness must be tempered by
   the understanding that not all progress will necessarily be good for all
   patients. The prognosis for most patients remains bleak, and we must
   remain vigilant to acute questions and concerns about welfare and
   quality of life.

AB Neuromarketing has recently generated controversies concerning the
   involvement of medical professionals, and many key questions remain-ones
   that have potentially important implications for the field of
   psychiatry. Conflicting definitions of neuromarketing have been
   proposed, and little is known about the actual practices of companies,
   physicians, and scientists involved in its practice. This article
   reviews the history of neuromarketing and uses an exploratory survey of
   neuromarketing Web sites to illustrate ethical issues raised by this new
   field. Neuromarketing, as currently practiced, is heterogeneous, as
   companies are offering a variety of technologies. Many companies employ
   academicians and professionals, but few list their clients or fees.
   Media coverage of neuromarketing appears disproportionately high
   compared to the paucity of peer-reviewed reports in the field. Companies
   may be making premature claims about the power of neuroscience to
   predict consumer behavior. Overall, neuromarketing has important
   implications for academic-industrial partnerships, the responsible
   conduct of research, and the public understanding of the brain. We
   explore these themes to uncover issues relevant to professional ethics,
   research, and policy. Of particular relevance to psychiatry,
   neuromarketing may be seen as an extension of the search for
   quantification and certainty in previously indefinite aspects of human
   behavior. (HARV REV PSYCHIATRY 2010;18:230-237.)

   Neurotechnology Part One: Practical and Ethical Issues
SO PAIN PHYSICIAN
LA English
DT Article
DE pain; assessment; neurotechnology; biotechnology; neuroethics; medicine
AB The pain clinician is confronted with the formidable task of
   objectifying the subjective phenomenon of pain so as to determine the
   right treatments for both the pain syndrome and the patient in whom the
   pathology is expressed. However, the experience of pain - and its
   expression - remains enigmatic. Can currently available evaluative
   tools, questionnaires, and scales actually provide adequately objective
   information about the experiential dimensions of pain? Can, or will,
   current and future iterations of biotechnology - whether used singularly
   or in combination (with other technologies as well as
   observational-behavioral methods) - afford objective validation of pain?
   And what of the clinical, ethical, legal and social issues that arise in
   and from the use - and potential misuse - of these approaches?
   Subsequent trajectories of clinical care depend upon the findings gained
   through the use of these techniques and their inappropriate employment -
   or misinterpretation of the results they provide - can lead to
   misdiagnoses and incorrect treatment.
   This essay is the first of a two-part series that explicates how the
   intellectual tasks of knowing about pain and the assessment of its
   experience and expression in the pain patient are constituent to the
   moral responsibility of pain medicine. Herein, we discuss the problem of
   pain and its expression, and those methods, techniques, and technologies
   available to bridge the gap between subjective experience and objective
   evaluation. We address how these assessment approaches are fundamental
   to apprehend both pain as an objective, neurological event, and its
   impact upon the subjective experience, existence, and expectations of
   the person in pain. In this way, we argue that the right use of
   technology - together with inter-subjectivity, compassion, and insight -
   can sustain the good of pain care as both a therapeutic and moral
   enterprise.

   provides readily available options, such as the anti-dementia drugs,
   e.g. acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine,
   rivastigmine) and memantine. Based on a systematic review we found that
   expectations about the potential of these drugs exceed their actual
   effects, as has been demonstrated in randomised controlled trials. Both
   single and repeated dose trials were included in the systematic review,
   however repeated dose trials have only been conducted for donepezil. In
   six small trials lasting 14-42 days, the following results emerged:
   donepezil improved the retention of training on complex aviation tasks
   and verbal memory for semantically processed words. In one study
   episodic memory was improved, whereas in others it remained unaffected
   by donepezil. In a sleep deprivation trial, donepezil reduced the memory
   and attention deficits resulting from 24 h of sleep deprivation. Two
   studies reported even transient negative effects. Regarding the safety
   profile of donepezil, these studies found that it was rather well
   tolerated. In any case, since large longitudinal studies are not
   available no conclusions can be drawn.
   Seven small studies about the effects of a single dose of memantine, and
   one study with a single dose of rivastigmine have been reported. Again,
   these studies are not adequate to answer our research question. If, as
   here and elsewhere suggested, the concept of pharmaceutical
   neuroenhancement is not to be rejected in principle, the decision of
   healthy individuals to take drugs for the purpose of neuroenhancement
   should be based on exhaustive information. At the moment, the research
   that would support or oppose the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
   and memantine for neuroenhancement by healthy individuals has not yet
   been performed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   deep brain stimulation of the central thalamus in the minimally
   conscious state. We describe ethical challenges faced in clinical
   research involving medical devices and offer several cautionary notes
   about its funding and the interplay of market forces and scientific

AB The prospects of enhancing cognitive or motor functions using
   neuroscience in otherwise healthy individuals has attracted considerable
   attention and interest in neuroethics (Farah et al., Nature Reviews
   Neuroscience 5:421-425, 2004; Glannon Journal of Medical Ethics
   32:74-78, 2006). The use of stimulants is one of the areas which has
   propelled the discussion on the potential for neuroscience to yield
   cognition-enhancing products. However, we have found in our review of
   the literature that the paradigms used to discuss the non-medical use of
   stimulant drugs prescribed for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder
   (ADHD) vary considerably. In this brief communication, we identify three
   common paradigms-prescription drug abuse, cognitive enhancement, and
   lifestyle use of pharmaceuticals-and briefly highlight how divergences
   between paradigms create important "ethics blind spots".

AB Since the Nuremberg trials (1947-1949), informed consent has become
   central for ethical practice in patient care and biomedical research.
   Codes of ethics emanating from the Nuremberg Code (1947) recognize the
   importance of protecting patients and research subjects from abuses,
   manipulation and deception. Informed consent empowers individuals to
   autonomously and voluntarily accept or reject participation in either
   clinical treatment or research. In some cases, however, the underlying
   mental or physical condition of the individual may alter his or her
   cognitive abilities and compromise the informed consent process. This is
   particularly true in chronic psychiatric conditions such as
   Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD), where individuals may fail to
   respond to traditional antidepressant treatments (e. g., psychotherapy,
   pharmacotherapy). Moreover, it may raise further concerns for an
   individual's motivation to consent and the level of understanding of the
   treatment or research procedure. This paper focuses on the informed
   consent process for Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) in the treatment of
   individuals diagnosed with TRD. Specifically, the paper addresses how
   depression may affect the decision-making capacity of an individual and
   the potential ethical and legal impact of failure to appreciate the
   seven elements of the consenting process (competence, voluntariness,
   disclosure, recommendation, understanding, decision, and authorization).
   To ensure the protection of vulnerable individuals with psychiatric
   disorders such as TRD and promote ethical behavior in biomedical
   research and patient care while avoiding potential legal pitfalls, we
   propose a paradigm that requires a stringent evaluation process of
   decision-making capacity for informed consent.

AB According to a widespread view, a complete explanatory reduction of all
   aspects of the human mind to the electro-chemical functioning of the
   brain is at hand and will certainly produce vast and positive cultural,
   political and social consequences. However, notwithstanding the
   astonishing advances generated by the neurosciences in recent years for
   our understanding of the mechanisms and functions of the brain, the
   application of these findings to the specific but crucial issue of human
   agency can be considered a "pre-paradigmatic science" (in Thomas Kuhn's
   sense). This implies that the situation is, at the same time,
   intellectually stimulating and methodologically confused. More
   specifically-because of the lack of a solid, unitary and coherent
   methodological framework as to how to connect neurophysiology and
   agency-it frequently happens that tentative approaches, bold but very
   preliminary claims and even clearly flawed interpretations of
   experimental data are taken for granted. In this article some examples
   of such conceptual confusions and intellectual hubris will be presented,
   which derive from the most recent literature at the intersection between
   neurosciences, on the one hand, and philosophy, politics and social
   sciences, on the other hand. It will also be argued that, in some of
   these cases, hasty and over-ambitious conclusions may produce negative
   social and political consequences. The general upshot will be that very
   much has still to be clarified as to what and how neurosciences can tell
   us about human agency and that, in the meantime, intellectual and
   methodological caution is to be recommended.

AB I will argue that the fairly common assumption that brain imaging may
   compromise people's privacy in an undesirable way only if moral crimes
   are committed is false. Sometimes persons' privacy is compromised
   because of failures of privacy. A normal emotional reaction to failures
   of privacy is embarrassment and shame, not moral resentment like in the
   cases of violations of right to privacy. I will claim that if (1)
   neuroimaging will provide all kinds of information about persons' inner
   life and not only information that is intentionally searched for, and
   (2) there will be more and more application fields of fMRI and more and
   more people whose brains will be scanned (without any coercion), then,
   in the future, shame may be an unfortunately common feeling in our
   culture. This is because failures of privacy may dramatically increase.
   A person may feel shame strongly and long, especially if his failure is
   witnessed by people who he considers relatively important, but less than
   perfectly trustworthy.

TI The Neuroscience of Pain, and a Neuroethics of Pain Care
SO NEUROETHICS
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB Neuroscience, together with a broadened concept of "mind" has instigated
   pragmatic and ethical concerns about the experience and treatment of
   pain. If pain medicine is to be authentic, it requires knowledge of the
   brain-mind, pain, and the relative and appropriate "goodness" of
   potential interventions that can and/or should be provided. This speaks
   to the need for an ethics that reflects and is relevant to the
   contemporary neuroscience of pain, acknowledgment and appreciation of
   the sentient being in pain, effects of environment and value(s), and the
   nature of healing. It may be that neuroethics provides this viable
   meta-ethic for pain care. This essay describes how an integrative
   neuroethics of pain care allows, if not obligates, alignment of facts,
   values, and moral attitudes as a continuing process of re-investigation,
   analysis, and revision of what we know (and don't know) about brains,
   minds, selves, and how we regard and treat the painient.

AB THE CURRENT AND POTENTIAL USES OF neuroimaging in healthcare and beyond
   have spurred discussion about the ethical issues related to neuroimaging
   and neuroimaging research. This study examined the perspectives of
   neuroimagers on ethical issues in their research and on the ethics
   review process. One hundred neuroimagers from 13 Canadian neuroscience
   centers completed an online survey and 35 semi-structured interviews
   were conducted. Neuroimagers felt that most ethical and social issues
   identified in the literature were dealt with adequately, well, and even
   very well by research ethics boards (REBs), but some issues such as
   incidental findings and transfer of knowledge were problematic.
   Neuroimagers reported a range of practical problems in the ethics review
   process. We aimed to gather perspectives from REB on the ethics review
   process, but insufficient participation by REBs prevented us from
   reporting their perspectives. Given shortcomings identified by
   neuroimagers as well as longstanding issues in Canadian ethics
   governance, we believe that substantial challenges exist in Canadian
   research ethics governance that jeopardize trust, communication, and the
   overall soundness of research ethics governance. Neuroimagers and REBs
   should consider their shared responsibilities in developing guidance to
   handle issues such as incidental findings, risk assessment, and
   knowledge transfer.

ID INCIDENTAL FINDINGS; NEUROETHICS
AB Consideration of the ethical, social, and policy implications of
   research has become increasingly important to scientists and scholars
   whose work focuses on brain and mind, but limited empirical data exist
   on the education in ethics available to them. We examined the current
   landscape of ethics training in neuroscience programs, beginning with
   the Canadian context specifically, to elucidate the perceived needs of
   mentors and trainees and offer recommendations for resource development
   to meet those needs. We surveyed neuroscientists at all training levels
   and interviewed directors of neuroscience programs and training grants.
   A total of 88% of survey respondents reported general interest in
   ethics, and 96% indicated a desire for more ethics content as it applies
   to brain research and clinical translation. Expert interviews revealed
   formal ethics education in over half of programs and in 90% of
   grants-based programs. Lack of time, resources, and expertise, however,
   are major barriers to expanding ethics content in neuroscience
   education. We conclude with an initial set of recommendations to address
   these barriers which includes the development of flexible, tailored
   ethics education tools, increased financial support for ethics training,
   and strategies for fostering collaboration between ethics experts,
   neuroscience program directors, and funding agencies.

AB In line with their vast expansion over the last few decades, the brain
   sciences - including neurobiology, psychopharmacology, biological
   psychiatry, and brain imaging - are becoming increasingly prominent in a
   variety of cultural formations, from self-help guides and the arts to
   advertising and public health programmes. This article, which introduces
   the special issue of History of the Human Science on 'Neuroscience,
   Power and Culture', considers the ways that social and historical
   research can, through empirical investigations grounded in the
   observation of what is actually happening and has already happened in
   the sciences of mind and brain, complement speculative discussions of
   the possible social implications of neuroscience that now appear
   regularly in the media and in philosophical bioethics. It suggests that
   the neurosciences are best understood in terms of their lineage within

   be strengthened by drawing on existing literatures on the history and
   politics of psychology - particularly those that analyze formations of
   knowledge, power and subjectivity associated with the discipline and its
   practical applications. Additionally, it argues against taking today's
   neuroscientific facts and brain-targetting technologies as starting

   are shaped by historical, cultural and political-economic forces.

AB Background: The increasing use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in
   brain researches has led to growing concern over incidental findings
   (IFs). To establish a practical management protocol for Ifs, it is
   useful to know the actual prevalence and problems of IF management. In
   the present study, we report the prevalence proportion and some handling
   problems of IFs in healthy Japanese children, and suggest a management
   protocol from ethical and practical standpoints.
   Methods: Between 2006 and 2008, 120 healthy children aged 5-8 years
   participated in a structural MRI study conducted in a pediatric cohort
   in Japan. All MRI images were reviewed by a pediatric neurologist, and
   detected IFs were classified into 4 categories.
   Results: IFs of all categories were detected in 40 of the 110
   participants (36.4%) for whom T2-weighted or 3D-T1-weighted images were
   available. Findings of sinusitis and/or otitis media were most frequent
   (26.4%). Excluding these findings, the prevalence of IFs was still 10.9%
   (12 findings): 9 findings were categorized as "no referral" (8.2%), 2 as
   "routine referral" (1.8%), 1 as "urgent referral" (0.9%), and 0 as
   "immediate referral" (0.0%). In "routine referral" category, only one
   participant was referred for further examinations.
   Conclusions: Although the prevalence of IFs was high, the proportion of
   those requiring further examination was low. This result revealed a
   fairly high false-positive rate and suggested that evaluating equivocal
   findings was the most difficult part of IF management. A management
   protocol needs to include a process to properly assess the clinical
   importance of findings.

AB Recent neuroimaging studies have indicated a predominant role of the
   anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) in deception and moral cognition, yet
   the functional contribution of the aPFC to deceptive behavior remains
   unknown. We hypothesized that modulating the excitability of the aPFC by
   transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could reveal its
   functional contribution in generating deceitful responses. Forty-four
   healthy volunteers participated in a thief role-play in which they were
   supposed to steal money and then to attend an interrogation with the
   Guilty Knowledge Test. During the interrogation, participants received
   cathodal, anodal, or sham tDCS. Remarkably, inhibition of the aPFC by
   cathodal tDCS did not lead to an impairment of deceptive behavior but
   rather to a significant improvement. This effect manifested in faster
   reaction times in telling lies, but not in telling the truth, a decrease
   in sympathetic skin-conductance response and feelings of guilt while
   deceiving the interrogator and a significantly higher lying quotient
   reflecting skillful lying. Increasing the excitability of the aPFC by
   anodal tDCS did not affect deceptive behavior, confirming the
   specificity of the stimulation polarity. These findings give causal
   support to recent correlative data obtained by functional magnetic
   resonance imaging studies indicating a pivotal role of the aPFC in
   deception.

   and technological interfacing (see Acknowledgments). Inspired by
   discussions at this event, in this article, we further discuss the value
   of input from neuroscience for developing robots and machine interfaces,
   and the value of philosophy, the humanities, and the arts for
   identifying persistent links between human interfacing and broader
   ethical concerns. The importance of ongoing interdisciplinary debate and
   public communication on scientific and technical advances is also
   highlighted. Throughout, the authors explore the implications of the
   extended mind hypothesis for notions of moral accountability and

ID MORAL JUDGMENT; FEELINGS; DOG
AB Empirical research by Jonathan Haidt and Joshua Greene seems to support
   the idea that in moral decision-making under uncertainty, people follow
   their initial intuitions and 'gut feelings'. Rational judgements are at
   most rationalizations or afterthoughts in our judgements about risks.
   This paper will challenge the theoretical assumptions made by Greene and
   Haidt, by proposing a different theory of ethical intuitions and
   emotions. Ethical intuitions and emotions should not be conflated with
   spontaneous 'gut reactions'. Rather, ethical intuitions and emotions can
   be the source and the result of ethical reflection and deliberation.
   This allows for different interpretations of the empirical findings of
   Haidt and Greene and of psychologists who study emotional responses to
   risks, such as Paul Slovic and George Loewenstein. Emotional and
   intuitive responses to risk should not be seen as heuristics that are
   prone to be biases; rather, they should be seen as invaluable sources of
   insight when it comes to judging the moral acceptability of risks.

   Communicating science is challenging, and the transformation of

AB Detection of deception and confirmation of truth telling with
   conventional polygraphy raised a host of technical and ethical issues.
   Recently, newer methods of recording electromagnetic signals from the
   brain show promise in permitting the detection of deception or truth
   telling. Some are even being promoted as more accurate than conventional
   polygraphy. While the new technologies raise issues of personal privacy,
   acceptable forensic application, and other social issues, the focus of
   this paper is the technical limitations of the developing technology.
   Those limitations include the measurement validity of the new
   technologies, which remains largely unknown. Another set of questions
   pertains to the psychological paradigms used to model or constrain the
   target behavior. Finally, there is little standardization in the field,
   and the vulnerability of the techniques to countermeasures is unknown.
   Premature application of these technologies outside of research settings
   should be resisted, and the social conversation about the appropriate
   parameters of its civil, forensic, and security use should begin.

AB Background: Deep brain stimulation is an approved and effective
   neurosurgical intervention for motor disorders such as PD and ET. Deep
   brain stimulation may also be effective in treating a number of
   psychiatric disorders, including treatment refractory depression and
   OCD. Although DBS is a widely accepted therapy in motor disorders, it
   remains an invasive and expensive procedure. The ethical and social
   challenges of DBS need further examination, and discussion and emerging
   applications of DBS in psychiatry may also complicate the ethical
   landscape of DBS.
   Methods: To identify and characterize current and emerging issues in the
   use of DBS, we reviewed the neurosurgical literature on DBS as well as
   the interdisciplinary medical ethics and relevant psychological and
   sociological literatures. We also consulted the USPTO database, FDA
   regulations and report decisions, and the business reports of key DBS
   manufacturers.
   Results: Important ethical and social challenges exist in the current
   and extending practice of DBS, notably in patient selection, informed
   consent, resource allocation, and in public understanding. These
   challenges are likely to be amplified if emerging uses of DBS in
   psychiatry are approved.
   Conclusions: Our review of ethical and social issues related to DBS
   highlights that several significant challenges, although not
   insurmountable, need much closer attention. A combination of approaches
   previously used in neuroethics, such as expert consensus workshops to
   establish ethical guidelines and public engagement to improve public
   understanding, may be fruitful to explore. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Advances in intensive care medicine have increased survival rates of
   patients with critical neurological conditions. The focus of
   prognostication for such patients is therefore shifting from predicting
   chances of survival to meaningful neurological recovery. This study
   assessed the variability in long-term outcome predictions among
   physicians and aimed to identify factors that may account for this
   variability.
   Based on a clinical vignette describing a comatose patient suffering
   from post-anoxic brain injury intensivists were asked in a
   semi-structured interview about the patient's specific neurological
   prognosis and about prognostication in general. Qualitative research
   methods were used to identify areas of variability in prognostication
   and to classify physicians according to specific prognostication
   profiles. Quantitative statistics were used to assess for associations
   between prognostication profiles and physicians' demographic and
   practice characteristics.
   Eighteen intensivists participated. Functional outcome predictions
   varied along an evaluative dimension (fair/good-poor) and a confidence
   dimension (certain-uncertain). More experienced physicians tended to be
   more pessimistic about the patient's functional outcome and more certain
   of their prognosis. Attitudes toward quality of life varied along an
   evaluative dimension (good-poor) and a "style" dimension
   (objective-subjective). Older and more experienced physicians were more
   likely to express objective judgments of quality of life and to predict
   a worse quality of life for the patient than their younger and less
   experienced counterparts.
   Various prognostication profiles exist among intensivists. These may be
   dictated by factors such as physicians' age and clinical experience.
   Awareness of these associations may be a first step to more uniform
   prognostication.

AB Imaging genetics has emerged as a powerful and sensitive approach to the
   study of functional genetic variations and brain responses in
   psychiatric and neurologic disorders. Ethics issues in contemporary
   neuroscience as they apply separately to genetics and neuroimaging have
   been a growing focus for research but, to date, there has not yet been a
   rigorous exploration of the ethical dimensions of the territory in which
   they overlap. Here we propose that the ethics challenges associated with
   the combination of these methods call for an expanded "neuro-space" in
   which societal and ethical values are closely and explicitly integrated
   with the new science. We build specifically on the model delivered by
   Roffman et al. [Roffman JL, Weiss AP, Goff DC, Rauch SL, Weinberger DR
   (2006) Neuroimaging-genetic paradigms: a new approach to investigate the
   pathophysiology and treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.
   Harv Rev Psychiatry 14:78-91] for neuroimaging, and develop the argument
   that the ethics issues parallel the heightened discriminative and
   cumulative power of imaging genetics. In the new combined space,
   features of discriminative power concern better differentiation of
   disease, sometimes by ethnicity, and incidental findings. Clinical
   utility, prediction and intervention, and stigma and labeling reflect a
   common ground between discriminative and cumulative power. Privacy,
   autonomy, response sensitivity and attitudes, resource allocation for
   research and for health care, and commercialization, are features of
   cumulative power. Parallel to the clinical features highlighted in the
   Roffman et al. map, the combined space yields additional neuroethics
   features. These are characterized by new knowledge and new implications
   for health care, justice, and policy. We conclude by examining these
   features in the context of public health at the interface of emerging
   new neurotechnologies. (C) 2009 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established treatment option for some
   movement disorders, in particular Parkinson's disease. Only recently, a
   number of promising studies with small samples of patients have been
   published in which impressive therapeutic outcomes achieved by DBS in
   otherwise treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder, major
   depression, and Tourette's syndrome were reported. It seems probable
   that the investigational approach to treat mental disorders by DBS will
   increase substantially. Neurosurgical interventions in psychiatric
   patients raise ethical considerations not only based on the disreputable
   experiences of the era of psychosurgery. Therefore, it is necessary to
   implement transparent and well-defined regulations for the protection of
   the patients as well as appropriate support for therapeutic research.
   The current article aims to provide a synopsis of the DBS approach in
   mental disorders and the hitherto existing criteria for research. It
   suggests some additional requirements for ethically justifiable
   therapeutic research employing DBS in psychiatric patients.

   review neuroimaging studies of the psychotherapy of depression and
   discuss some of the methodological limitations inherent in functional
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and common fallacies perpetrated in
   interpreting fMRI studies. Finally, we discuss some neuroethical issues
   related to this new and active field of research. In sum, we argue that
   neuroscience harbors great potential and add-on value for improving
   psychotherapeutic practice and research if applied properly.

AB Purpose of review
   Neuroethics is a recently emerging field that deals with predominantly
   empirical and practical issues of ethics in neuroscience. In contrast,
   theoretical and methodological considerations have rather been neglected
   and thus what may be called theoretical neuroethics.
   Recent findings
   The review focuses on informed consent and moral judgment as examples of
   empirical neuroethics and norm-fact circularity and method-based
   neuroethics as issues of a theoretical neuroethics.
   Summary
   It is argued that we need to consider theoretical and methodological
   issues in order to develop neuroethics as a distinct discipline, which
   as such can be distinguished from both philosophy/ethics and
   neuroscience.

AB Though the vegetarian movement sparked by Peter Singer's book Animal
   Liberation has achieved some success, there is more animal suffering
   caused today due to factory farming than there was when the book was
   originally written. In this paper, I argue that there may be a
   technological solution to the problem of animal suffering in intensive
   factory farming operations. In particular, I suggest that recent
   research indicates that we may be very close to, if not already at, the
   point where we can genetically engineer factory-farmed livestock with a
   reduced or completely eliminated capacity to suffer. In as much as
   animal suffering is the principal concern that motivates the animal
   welfare movement, this development should be of central interest to its
   adherents. Moreover, I will argue that all people concerned with animal
   welfare should agree that we ought to replace the animals currently used
   in factory farming with animals whose ability to suffer is diminished if
   we are able to do so.

ID CONSCIOUSNESS; DISORDERS
AB To aid neuroscientists in determining the ethical limits of their work
   and its applications, neuroethical problems need to be identified,
   catalogued, and analyzed from the standpoint of an ethical framework.
   Many hospitals have already established either autonomy or
   welfare-centered theories as their adopted ethical framework.
   Unfortunately, the choice of an ethical framework resists resolution:
   each of these two moral theories claims priority at the exclusion of the
   other, but for patients with neurological pathologies, concerns about
   the patient's welfare are treated as meaningless without consideration
   of the patient's expressed wishes, and vice versa. Ethicists have long
   fought over whether suffering or autonomy should be our primary concern,
   but in neuroethics a resolution of this question is essential to
   determine the treatment of patients in medical and legal limbo. I
   propose a solution to this problem in the form of ethical dualism. This
   is a conservative measure in that it retains both sides of the debate:
   both happiness and autonomy have intrinsic value. However, this move is
   often met with resistance because of its more complex nature-it is more
   difficult to make a decision when there are two parallel sets of values
   that must be considered than when there is just one such set. The monist
   theories, though, do not provide enough explanatory power: namely, I
   will present two recently publicized cases where it is clear that
   neither ethical value on its own (neither welfare nor autonomy) can
   fully account for how a vegetative patient should be treated. From the
   neuroethical cases of Terri Schiavo and Lauren Richardson, I will argue
   that a dualist framework is superior to its monist predecessors, and I
   will describe the main features of such an account.

AB There is mounting evidence that methylphenidate (MPH; Ritalin) is being
   used by healthy college students to improve concentration, alertness,
   and academic performance. One of the key concerns associated with such
   use of pharmaceuticals is the degree of freedom individuals have to
   engage in or abstain from cognitive enhancement (CE). From a pragmatic
   perspective, careful examination of the ethics of acts and contexts in
   which they arise includes considering coercion and social pressures to
   enhance cognition. We were interested in understanding how university
   students, parents of university students, and healthcare providers
   viewed autonomy and coercion in CE using MPH. We found that perspectives
   converged on the belief that CE is a matter of personal and individual
   choice. Perspectives also converged on the existence of tremendous
   social pressures to perform and succeed. Parents emphasized personal
   responsibility and accountability for CE choices, and expressed feelings
   of worry, sadness and fear about CE. Students emphasized the importance
   of personal integrity in CE, expressed tolerance for personal choices of
   others, and highlighted the challenge that CE poses to maintaining one's
   personal integrity. Healthcare providers emphasized the health
   consequences of CE. These results illustrate: (1) the importance of
   understanding how context is viewed in relation to perspectives on
   autonomous choice; (2) the limitations of individualistic libertarian
   approaches that do not consider social context; and (3) the ethical
   implications of public health interventions in a value-laden debate
   where perspectives diverge.

AB Neuroscience addresses questions that, if resolved, will reveal aspects
   of our individuality. Therefore neuroscientific knowledge is not solely
   constrained within laboratories, but readily captures the attention of
   the public at large. Ideas, concepts and images in neuroscience widely
   circulate in culture and are portrayed in literature, film, works of
   art, the mass media and commercial products, therefore shaping social
   values and consumer practices. The interaction between art and science
   offers an opportunity to make the scientific community and the public
   aware of the social and ethical implications of the scientific advances
   in neuroscience.

AB Research in the area of Neurosciences has been continuely advancing in
   recent years and much of the progress has direct or indirect
   implications on the population. The possibility of learning the basis of
   the human personality and thus having better control of their actions,
   is a challenge for science. This has not been overlooked in society,
   above all due to the work of the communication media, which considers
   these subjects an important and attractive part of the information
   content. This situation of often-vertiginous advance and the
   consequences in some social areas led to the emergence not long ago of
   Neuroethics as a science, which deals with social, legal and ethical
   questions of Neurosciences and the ethical problems of research in I his
   Field. Neuroethics is a newly created discipline whose definition has
   not been clearly defined, but which has an important role nowadays, with
   a continuous need for change and renovation to continue the advances in
   research and evolution and changes of society.

AB Neuroethics is a new subset of bioethics that addresses ethical issues
   pertaining to the brain, primarily in the fields of neuroscience,
   cognitive science, and neuroradiology. Research in brain science is
   progressing at a phenomenal rate and, as a result, the acquisition and
   application of knowledge and technology raises ethical questions of a
   practical and philosophical nature. While neuroethics is developing as a
   distinct field of study, one area that should be addressed in greater
   depth is the relevance and potential impact of neurotechnology in
   psychiatry. New knowledge in the mind-brain conundrum and increasingly
   sophisticated techniques for imaging and intervening in human cognition,
   emotion, and behavior pose ethical issues at the intersection of
   technology and psychiatry. This article presents a broad survey of the
   new directions in neuroethics, neuroscience, and technology and
   considers the implications of technological advances for the practice of
   psychiatry in the new millennium. (Journal of Psychiatric Practice

ID TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; COLLEGE
AB This paper integrates some Buddhist moral values, attitudes and
   self-cultivation techniques into a discussion of the ethics of cognitive
   enhancement technologies - in particular, pharmaceutical enhancements.
   Many Buddhists utilize meditation techniques that are both integral to
   their practice and are believed to enhance the cognitive and affective
   states of experienced practitioners. Additionally, Mahyna Buddhism's
   teaching on skillful means permits a liberal use of methods or
   techniques in Buddhist practice that yield insight into our selfnature
   or aid in alleviating or eliminating duhkha (i.e. dissatisfaction).
   These features of many, if not most, Buddhist traditions will inform
   much of the Buddhist assessment of pharmaceutical enhancements offered
   in this paper. Some Buddhist concerns about the effects and context of
   the use of pharmaceutical enhancements will be canvassed in the
   discussion. Also, the author will consider Buddhist views of the
   possible harms that may befall human and nonhuman research subjects,
   interference with a recipient's karma, the artificiality of
   pharmaceutical enhancements, and the possible motivations or intentions
   of healthy individuals pursuing pharmacological enhancement. Perhaps
   surprisingly, none of these concerns will adequately ground a reflective
   Buddhist opposition to the further development and continued use of
   pharmaceutical enhancements, either in principle or in practice. The
   author argues that Buddhists, from at least certain traditions -
   particularly Mahyna Buddhist traditions - should advocate the
   development or use of pharmaceutical enhancements if a consequence of
   their use is further insight into our self-nature or the reduction or
   alleviation of duhkha.

AB Neuroethics, in its modern form, investigates the impact of brain
   science in four basic dimensions: the self, social policy, practice and
   discourse. In this study, we analyzed a set of 461 peer-reviewed
   articles with neuroethics content, published by authors from 32
   countries. We analyzed the data for: (1) trends in the development of
   international neuroethics over time, and (2) how challenges at the
   intersection of ethics and neuroscience are viewed in countries that are
   considered developed by International Monetary Fund (IMF) standards, and
   in those that are developing. Our results demonstrate a steady increase
   in global participation in neuroethics from 1989 to 2005, characterized
   by an increase in numbers of articles published specifically on
   neuroethics, journals publishing these articles, and countries
   contributing to the literature. The focus from all countries was on the
   practice of brain science and the amelioration of neurological disease.
   Indicators of technology creation and diffusion in developing countries
   were specifically correlated with increases in publications concerning
   policy implications of brain science. Neuroethics is an international
   endeavor and, as such, should be sensitive to the impact that context
   has on acceptance and use of technological innovation.

   MODEL
AB In the study of aggression, psychopathy represents a disorder that is of
   particular interest because it often involves aggression which is
   premeditated, emotionless, and instrumental in nature; this is
   especially true for more serious types of offenses. Such instrumental
   aggression is aimed at achieving a goal (e.g., to obtain resources such
   as money, or to gain status). Unlike the primarily reactive aggression
   observed in other disorders, psychopaths appear to engage in aggressive
   acts for the purpose of benefiting themselves. This is especially
   interesting in light of arguments that psychopathy may represent an
   alternative life-history strategy that is evolutionarily adaptive;
   behaviors such as aggression, risk-taking, manipulation, and promiscuous
   sexual behavior observed in psychopathy may be means by which
   psychopaths gain advantage over others. Recent neurobiological research
   supports the idea that abnormalities in brain regions key to emotion and
   morality may allow psychopaths to pursue such a strategy-psychopaths may
   not experience the social emotions such as empathy, guilt, and remorse
   that typically discourage instrumentally aggressive acts, and may even
   experience pleasure when committing these acts. Findings from brain
   imaging studies of psychopaths may have important implications for the
   law. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE autonomy; neuroethics; unconscious brain events
AB Informed consent is the practical expression of the doctrine of
   autonomy. But the very idea of autonomy and conscious free choice is
   undercut by the view that human beings react as their unconscious brain
   centres dictate, depending on factors that may or may not be under
   rational control and reflection. This worry is, however, based on a
   faulty model of human autonomy and consciousness and needs close
   neurophilosophical scrutiny. A critique of the ethics implied by the
   model takes us towards a 'care of the self' view of autonomy and the
   subject's attunement to the truth as the crux of reasoning rather than
   the inner mental/neural state views of autonomy and human choice on
   offer at present.

TI EPISTEMOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS ON NEUROIMAGING - A CRUCIAL PREREQUISITE
   FOR NEUROETHICS
SO BIOETHICS
LA English
DT Article
DE epistemology; philosophy of science; neuroethics; neuroimaging;
   neuroscience
AB Purpose: Whereas ethical considerations on imaging techniques and
   interpretations of neuroimaging results flourish, there is not much work
   on their preconditions. In this paper, therefore, we discuss
   epistemological considerations on neuroimaging and their implications
   for neuroethics.
   Results: Neuroimaging uses indirect methods to generate data about
   surrogate parameters for mental processes, and there are many
   determinants influencing the results, including current hypotheses and
   the state of knowledge. This leads to an interdependence between
   hypotheses and data. Additionally, different levels of description are
   involved, especially when experiments are designed to answer questions
   pertaining to broad concepts like the self, empathy or moral intentions.
   Interdisciplinary theoretical frameworks are needed to integrate
   findings from the life sciences and the humanities and to translate
   between them. While these epistemological issues are not specific for
   neuroimaging, there are some reasons why they are of special importance
   in this context: Due to their inferential proximity, 'neuro-images' seem
   to be self-evident, suggesting directness of observation and
   objectivity. This has to be critically discussed to prevent
   overinterpretation. Additionally, there is a high level of attention to
   neuroimaging, leading to a high frequency of presentation of
   neuroimaging data and making the critical examination of their
   epistemological properties even more pressing.
   Conclusions: Epistemological considerations are an important
   prerequisite for neuroethics. The presentation and communication of the
   results of neuroimaging studies, the potential generation of new
   phenomena and new 'dysfunctions' through neuroimaging, and the influence
   on central concepts at the foundations of ethics will be important
   future topics for this discipline.

SO BIOETHICS

DE neuroimaging; ethics; psychiatry; neuroethics; DSM; nosology
AB According to many researchers, it is inevitable and obvious that
   psychiatric illnesses are biological in nature, and that this is the
   rationale behind the numerous neuroimaging studies of individuals
   diagnosed with mental disorders. Scholars looking at the history of
   psychiatry have pointed out that in the past, the origins and
   motivations behind the search for biological causes, correlates, and
   cures for mental disorders are thoroughly social and historically
   rooted, particularly when the diagnostic category in question is the
   subject of controversy within psychiatry. This is obscured by
   neuroimaging studies that drive researchers to proclaim 'revolutions' in
   psychiatry, namely in the DSM. Providing neuroimaging evidence to
   support the contention that a condition is 'real' is likely to be
   extremely influential, as has been extensively discussed in the
   neuroethics literature. This type of evidence will also reinforce the
   pre-existing beliefs of those researchers or clinicians who are already
   expecting a biological description. The uncritical credence given to
   neuroimaging research is an ethical issue, not in its potential for
   contributing to misdiagnosis per se but because of the motivations that
   often drive this research. My claim is that this research should proceed
   with an awareness of presumptions and motivations underlying the field
   as a whole, in addition to an explicit focus on the past and potential
   future consequences of classification and diagnosis on the groups of
   individuals under study.

AB There is concern that the use of neuroenhancements to alter character
   traits undermines consumer's authenticity. But the meaning, scope and
   value of authenticity remain vague. However, the majority of
   contemporary autonomy accounts ground individual autonomy on a notion of
   authenticity. So if neuroenhancements diminish an agent's authenticity,
   they may undermine his autonomy. This paper clarifies the relation
   between autonomy, authenticity and possible threats by
   neuroenhancements. We present six neuroenhancement scenarios and analyse
   how autonomy accounts evaluate them. Some cases are considered
   differently by criminal courts; we demonstrate where academic autonomy
   theories and legal reasoning diverge and ascertain whether courts should
   reconsider their concept of autonomy. We argue that authenticity is not
   an appropriate condition for autonomy and that new enhancement
   technologies pose no unique threats to personal autonomy.

DT Article
DE enhancement; personal identity; neurosurgery; neuroethics
AB Recent developments in the field of neurosurgery, specifically those
   dealing with the modification of mood and affect as part of psychiatric
   disease, have led some researchers to discuss the ethical implications
   of surgery to alter personality and personal identity. As knowledge and
   technology advance, discussions of surgery to alter undesirable traits,
   or possibly the enhancement of normal traits, will play an increasingly
   larger role in the ethical literature. So far, identity and enhancement
   have yet to be explored in a neurosurgical context, despite the fact
   that 1) neurological disease and treatment both potentially alter
   identity, and 2) that neurosurgeons will likely be the purveyors of
   future enhancement implantable technology. Here, we use interviews with
   neurosurgical patients to shed light on the ethical issues and
   challenges that surround identity and enhancement in neurosurgery. The
   results provide insight into how patients approach their identity prior
   to potentially identity-altering procedures and what future ethical
   challenges lay ahead for clinicians and researchers in the field of
   neurotherapeutics.

AB We briefly review the motivation, ethical framing, and results of a
   recent single-subject study of central thalamic deep brain stimulation
   (DBS) in a patient remaining in the chronic minimally conscious state
   (MCS). In the study, a severely brain-injured human subject showed
   behavioral improvements in attentive responsiveness, limb control,
   recovery of oral feeding, and spoken language following central thalamic
   DBS.(1) These findings are placed into the context of, and contrasted
   with, prior efforts applying thalamic brain stimulation to patients in
   the vegetative state (VS). Efforts to develop DBS for recovery of
   function in the setting of disorders of consciousness must meet several
   challenges presented by the expected wide variance of underlying brain
   injuries and need to carefully identify potential goals of therapeutic
   intervention. Although the study involved only a single subject, the
   results demonstrate a causal relationship between brain stimulation and
   cognitive recovery. The generalizability of these findings is completely
   unknown and the complexity of the problem will require careful and
   systematic research to move forward.

   given rise to a new field of study, neuroethics, which seeks to explore
   the moral questions that arise from the use of new brain-based therapies
   and from our growing understanding of the biology of human behavior,
   cognition, and emotion. The authors present an overview of selected
   topics in neuroethics that may be of special interest to psychiatrists,
   including a discussion of how genetics and functional neuroimaging have
   added nuance and complexity to mind/body dualism, the concept of free
   will, and the proper role of emotion in morality. Other topics include
   the use of brain-based therapies such as neuromodulation,
   psychopharmacology, and genetic technologies as enhancements to normal

AB There is a widespread similarity between diagnoses in general psychiatry
   compared with those found in Forensic psychiatry. Consequently, forensic
   psychiatrists face serious cases that need to undergo treatment by
   electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Although it is a well known and valid
   treatment, ECT is rarely applied to forensic-psychiatric patients or
   prisoners as well. This might be due to the general assumption that
   detained individuals, either in forensic psychiatry or in prisons, will
   not be chosen for a therapy, which is merely looked on as an emergency
   treatment. Besides, informed consent might be estimated not valid in
   such persons. However, the use of ECT in forensic psychiatry or prisons
   cannot be denied anymore because diagnoses and indications for ECT
   parallel the situation in general psychiatry.
   With the numbers of schizophrenic and depressive patients considerably
   increasing in the past years in our forensic unit, we estimate the
   indication for ECT in forensic psychiatry of approximately 3% and 12.5%,
   respectively.

   issues related to the donation of cells, gametes, or embryos for
   research. In this commentary, we move beyond these ethical concerns to
   discuss new themes that scientists on the forefront of NRM development
   anticipate, providing a preliminary framework for further discussion
   between scientists and ethicists. Fostering strong partnerships between
   neuroscientists and ethicists that operate and collaborate within this

AB Michael S. Gazzaniga, a pioneer and world leader in cognitive
   neuroscience, has made an initial attempt to develop neuroethics into a
   brain-based philosophy of life that he hopes will replace the irrational
   religious and political belief-systems that still partly govern modern
   societies. This article critically examines Gazzaniga's proposal and
   shows that his actual moral arguments have little to do with
   neuroscience. Instead, they are based on unexamined political, cultural
   and moral conceptions, narratives and values. A more promising way of
   interpreting the belief-forming system of the brain is to say that we
   cannot avoid thinking in terms of wider frameworks and narratives that
   are socially embedded and historically developed; consequently, any
   moral discussion has to be in terms of these frameworks and narratives.

SO NEUROETHICS

DT Article
DE Bioethics; Free will; Identity; Neuroethics; Self
AB Over the past few years, a number of authors in the new field of
   neuroethics have claimed that there is an ethical challenge presented by
   the likelihood that the findings of neuroscience will undermine many
   common assumptions about human agency and selfhood. These authors claim
   that neuroscience shows that human agents have no free will, and that
   our sense of being a "self" is an illusory construction of our brains.
   Furthermore, some commentators predict that our ethical practices of
   assigning moral blame, or of recognizing others as persons rather than
   as objects, will change as a result of neuroscientific discoveries that
   debunk free will and the concept of the self. I contest suggestions that
   neuroscience's conclusions about the illusory nature of free will and
   the self will cause significant change in our practices. I argue that we
   have self-interested reasons to resist allowing neuroscience to
   determine core beliefs about ourselves.

AB We outline the framework of the new project of Critical Neuroscience: a
   reflexive scientific practice that responds to the social, cultural and
   political challenges posed by the advances in the behavioural and brain
   sciences. Indeed, the new advances in neuroscience have given rise to
   growing projects of the sociology of neuroscience as well as
   neuroethics. In parallel, however, there is also a growing gulf between
   social studies of neuroscience and empirical neuroscience itself. This
   is where Critical Neuroscience finds its place. Here, we begin with a
   sketch of several forms of critique that can contribute to developing a
   model of critical scientific practice. We then describe a set of core
   activities that jointly make up the practice of Critical Neuroscience as
   it can be applied and practised both within and outside of neuroscience.
   We go on to propose three possible areas of application: (1) the
   problems related to new possibilities of neuropharmacological
   interventions; (2) the importance of culture, and the problems of
   reductionism, in psychiatry; (3) the use of imaging data from
   neuroscience in the law as alleged evidence about 'human nature'.

AB Modern advancements in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   technology have given neuroscientists the opportunity to more fully
   appreciate the brain's contribution to human behavior and decision
   making. Morality and moral reasoning are relative newcomers to the
   growing literature on decision neuroscience. With recent attention given
   to the salience of moral factors (e.g. moral emotions, moral reasoning)
   in the process of decision making, neuroscientists have begun to offer
   helpful frameworks for understanding the interplay between the brain,
   morality, and human decision making. These frameworks are relatively
   unfamiliar to the community of forensic psychologists, despite the fact
   that they offer an improved understanding of judicial decision making
   from a biological perspective. This article presents a framework
   reviewing how event-feature motion complexes (EFEC) are relevant to
   jurors and understanding complex criminal behavior. Future directions
   regarding converging fields of neuroscience and legal decision making
   are considered. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB If personhood is the quality or condition of being an individual person,
   brainhood could name the quality or condition of being a brain. This
   ontological quality would define the 'cerebral subject' that has, at
   least in industrialized and highly medicalized societies, gained
   numerous social inscriptions since the mid-20th century. This article
   explores the historical development of brainhood. It suggests that the
   brain is necessarily the location of the 'modern self', and that,
   consequently, the cerebral subject is the anthropological figure
   inherent to modernity (at least insofar as modernity gives supreme value
   to the individual as autonomous agent of choice and initiative). It
   further argues that the ideology of brainhood impelled neuroscientific
   investigation much more than it resulted from it, and sketches how an
   expanding constellation of neurocultural discourses and practices
   embodies and sustains that ideology.

AB In this article, we critically examine some of the ethical challenges
   and interpretive difficulties with possible future non-clinical
   applications of pediatric fMRI with a particular focus on applications
   in the classroom and the courtroom - two domains in which children come
   directly in contact with the state. We begin with a general overview of
   anticipated clinical and non-clinical applications of pediatric fMRI.
   This is followed by a detailed analysis of a range of ethical challenges
   and interpretive difficulties that trouble the use of fMRI and are
   likely to be especially acute with non-clinical uses of the technology.
   We conclude that knowledge of these challenges and difficulties should
   influence policy decisions regarding the non-clinical uses of fMRI. Our
   aim is to encourage the development of future policies prescribing the
   responsible use of this neuroimaging technology as it develops both
   within and outside the clinical setting.

AB The human brain is subjective and reflects the life of a
   being-in-the-world-with-others whose identity reflects that complex
   engaged reality. Human subjectivity is shaped and in-formed (formed by
   inner processes) that are adapted to the human life-world and embody
   meaning and the relatedness of a human being. Questions of identity
   relate to this complex and dynamic reality to reflect the fact that
   biology, human ecology, culture, and one's historic-political situation
   are inscribed in one's neural network and have configured its
   architecture so that it is a unique and irreplaceable phenomenon. So
   much is a human individual a relational being whose own understanding
   and ownership of his or her life is both situated and distinctive that
   neurophilosophical conceptions of identity and human activity that
   neglect these features of our being are quite inadequate to ground a
   robust neuroethics.

   recommendations are offered on how forensic psychiatrists can add to
   this research, given their professional interface between law and

AB Functional neuroimaging has been used to study a wide array of
   psychological traits, including aspects of personality and intelligence.
   Progress in identifying the neural correlates of individual differences
   in such traits, for the sake of basic science, has moved us closer to
   the applied science goal of measuring them and thereby raised ethical
   concerns about privacy. How realistic are such concerns given the
   current state of the art? In this article, we describe the statistical
   basis of the measurement of psychological traits using functional
   neuroimaging and examine the degree to which current functional
   neuroimaging protocols could be used for this purpose. By analyzing the
   published data from 16 studies, we demonstrate that the use of imaging
   to gather information about an individual's psychological traits is
   already possible, but to an extremely limited extent.

   This study was designed to find out whether Adderall impairs creativity
   in healthy young adults.
   In a double-blind placebo-controlled study, the effects of Adderall on
   the performance of 16 healthy young adults were measured on four tests
   of creativity from the psychological literature: two tasks requiring
   divergent thought and two requiring convergent thought.
   Adderall affected performance on the convergent tasks only, in one case
   enhancing it, particularly for lower-performing individuals, and in the
   other case enhancing it for the lower-performing and impairing it for
   higher-performing individuals.
   The preliminary evidence is inconsistent with the hypothesis that
   Adderall has an overall negative effect on creativity. Its effects on
   divergent creative thought cannot be inferred with confidence from this
   study because of the ambiguity of null results. Its effects on
   convergent creative thought appear to be dependent on the baseline
   creativity of the individual. Those in the higher range of the normal
   distribution may be unaffected or impaired, whereas those in the lower
   range of the normal distribution experience enhancement.

AB Neuroethics, the study of the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying
   ethical decision-making, is a growing field of study. In this review, we
   identify and discuss four themes emerging from neuroethics research.
   First, ethical decision-making appears to be distinct from other types
   of decision-making processes. Second, ethical decision-making entails
   more than just conscious reasoning. Third, emotion plays a critical role
   in ethical decision-making, at least under certain circumstances.
   Lastly, normative approaches to morality have distinct, underlying
   neural mechanisms. On the basis of these themes, we draw implications
   for research in business ethics and the practice of ethics training.

AB Using time as an over-arching metaphor, and drawing upon resources in
   the sciences, humanities, and the history of medicine, the author
   addresses the neuroethics of measuring and modulating consciousness.
   Static and evolving views of time dating to the Ancients are contrasted
   and applied to severe brain injury. These temporal worldviews are
   tracked progressively in the philosophies of Democritus and Heraclitus,
   Hippocrates and Galen, and the neurosurgeon, Wilder Penfield on into the
   modern era as they relate to current perceptions related to disorders of
   consciousness. These disorders, typified by the vegetative and minimally
   conscious states, can be viewed as either fixed and immutable or in flux
   depending upon social currents and scientific knowledge. Variable
   perspectives are examined in light of right-to-die cases involving
   permanently vegetative patients like Quinlan and Schiavo and contrasting
   "late" recoveries involving patients in the minimally conscious state.
   The author suggests that disorders of consciousness should not be viewed
   categorically as static entities but rather assessed as a reflection of
   a synchrony of time and biology that we are just beginning to
   understand. He stresses the relationship of temporality to clinical
   evaluation, diagnosis assessment, and prognostication and their
   association to new methods in functional neuroimaging. These time stamps
   have profound implications for systems of care and reimbursement
   mechanisms, which often mistakenly conflates futility with chronicity.
   This conflation is increasingly being challenged by patients who emerge
   from the minimally conscious state after conventional temporal
   expectations for improvement had transpired. These cases often referred
   to as "late emergences" point to the importance of better understanding
   the natural history of these conditions and the tempo of associated
   recoveries.

AB Writing 50 years after the publication of C. R Snow's Two Cultures and
   The Scientific Revolution, this paper considers the many cultures that
   have to intersect to sustain and deepen the advances in the diagnosis
   and treatment of patients with disorders of consciousness. To bridge
   this "two-culture divide," the paper contextualizes scientific
   developments in this field within work in medical ethics and the
   humanities. The author asserts that this line of inquiry cannot go
   forward responsibly absent input from the humanities and an appreciation
   of the lived experiences of patients and families who confront the
   quotidian and existential challenges of severe brain injury.

AB Success in functional neuroimaging has brought the promise of
   quantitative data in the form of brain images to the diagnosis of
   disorders of the central nervous system for which only qualitative
   clinical criteria have previously existed. Even though the translation
   of research to clinical neuroimaging for conditions such as major
   depression may not be available yet, rapid innovation along this
   trajectory of discovery to implementation compels exploration of how
   such information will eventually affect providers and patients. Clinical
   neuroethics is devoted to elucidating ethical challenges prior to and
   during the transfer of new research capabilities to the bedside. Through
   a model of proactive ethics, clinical neuroethics promotes the
   development of responsible social and public policies in response to new
   diagnostic and prognostic capabilities for the benefit of patients and
   their families, and for providers within the health care systems in
   which they practice. To examine views about the potential interaction of
   clinical neuroimaging and depression, we surveyed both mental health
   providers and outpatients and inpatients diagnosed with major depressive
   disorder. From responses of 52 providers and 72 patients, we found high
   receptivity to brain scans for treatment tailoring and choice, for
   improving understanding of and coping with disease, and for mitigating
   the effects of stigma and self-blame. Our results suggest that, once
   ready, roll out of the fully validated technology has significant
   potential to reduce social burden associated with highly stigmatized
   illnesses like depression. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   those who object to the prospective use of propranolol to prevent or
   treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), most obstreperous among
   them the President's Council on Bioethics, the use of propranolol can be
   justified for patients with severe PTSD. Propranolol, if effective, will
   alter the quality of certain memories in the brain. But this is not a
   serious threat to the self understood in terms of narrative identity. A
   narrative identity framework acknowledges that memory is always being
   subtly altered or modified. For severe cases of PTSD propranolol may
   help victims who don't respond to any other therapy or therapy
   combination regain their authentic self-narrative and engage once more
   in life activities. For those whose symptoms are not so severe the
   potential risks and side-effects of the drug may outweigh the benefits.
   Patients and family members should be allowed to decide, in consultation
   with their physician, whether this drug is appropriate in their case.

AB Purpose of review
   The field of neuroethics is experiencing a great deal of activity at
   present, as researchers come to realize the potentially dramatic
   implications of new work in neuroscience and its applications. This
   review aims to describe some of the work of direct relevance to
   psychiatric ethics.
   Recent findings
   The review focuses on ethical issues surrounding the use of propranolol
   to treat or prevent posttraumatic stress disorder, issues concerning the
   capacity of the mentally ill to give informed consent to medical
   treatment and the potential social implications of cognitive enhancers
   and other interventions into the mind.
   Summary
   It is argued that psychiatric ethics would benefit from a consideration
   of cognate questions arising in neuroethics; in particular, neuroethics
   has the potential to remind psychiatrists that individual treatment
   decisions can have broad social implications.

AB Purpose of review To give an overview of recent developments in
   neuroimaging in psychiatry and on the current discussion about the
   relationship between theoretical concepts and data from neuroimaging
   studies.
   Recent findings
   In psychiatric neuroimaging, broad concepts such as the self, well
   being, insight, empathy and volition form an integral part of the
   questions to be answered and cannot be avoided. Although, currently, the
   intradisciplinary discussion in neuroscience is mainly focused at the
   methodological and neurobiological level, psychological and
   philosophical theories are also needed for the interpretation of
   results. This raises questions regarding the epistemic priority of
   neuroimaging data and theories.
   Summary
   In the current paper, we present the hypothesis that there is an
   interdependence of neuroimaging data and theoretical concepts. An
   approach to 'correlational neuroscience' with an awareness of this issue
   may help in avoiding misunderstandings and oversimplifications as well
   as building an interdisciplinary theoretical framework that is able to
   integrate findings from life sciences, mind sciences and humanities.

AB Neuroimaging is increasingly used to understand conditions like stroke
   and epilepsy. However, there is growing recognition that neuroimaging
   can raise ethical issues. We used interpretative phenomenological
   analysis to analyse interview data pre-and post-scan to explore these
   ethical issues. Findings show participants can become anxious prior to
   scanning and the protocol for managing incidental findings is unclear.
   Participants lacked a frame of reference to contextualize their
   expectations and often drew on medical narratives. Recommendations to
   reduce anxiety include dialogue between researcher and participant to
   clarify understanding during consent and the use of a 'virtual tour' of
   the neuroimaging experience.

AB The way in which we characterize the structural and functional
   differences between psychopath and normal brains - either as biological
   disorders or as mere biological differences - can influence our
   judgments about psychopaths' responsibility for criminal misconduct.
   However, Marga Reimer (Neuroethics 1(2): 14, 2008) points out that
   whether our characterization of these differences should be allowed to
   affect our judgments in this manner "is a difficult and important
   question that really needs to be addressed before policies regarding
   responsibility... can be implemented with any confidence". This paper is
   an attempt to address Reimer's difficult and important question; I argue
   that irrespective of which of these two characterizations is chosen, our
   judgments about psychopaths' responsibility should not be affected,
   because responsibility hinges not on whether a particular difference is
   (referred to as) a disorder or not, but on how that difference affects
   the mental capacities required for moral agency

   the development of the leukotomy, and follows the rise and fall of its
   popularity in the 1900s. The reemergence of psychosurgical procedures
   and the development of new therapeutic technologies such as vagus nerve

   introduction to the field of neuroethics is provided, given its
   importance in any discussion about surgical therapy for psychiatric

TI Extending Our View on Using BCIs for Locked-in Syndrome
SO NEUROETHICS

DT Article
DE Brain-computer interfaces; Locked-in syndrome; Extended mind theory;
   Neuroethics; Autonomy
AB Locked-in syndrome (LIS) is a severe neurological condition that
   typically leaves a patient unable to move, talk and, in many cases,
   initiate communication. Brain Computer Interfaces (or BCIs) promise to
   enable individuals with conditions like LIS to re-engage with their
   physical and social worlds. In this paper we will use extended mind
   theory to offer a way of seeing the potential of BCIs when attached to,
   or implanted in, individuals with LIS. In particular, we will contend
   that functionally integrated BCIs extend the minds of individuals with
   LIS beyond their bodies, allowing them greater autonomy than they can
   typically hope for in living with their condition. This raises important
   philosophical questions about the implications of BCI technology,
   particularly the potential to change selves, and ethical questions about
   whether society has a responsibility to aid these individuals in
   re-engaging with their physical and social worlds. It also raises some
   important questions about when these interventions should be offered to
   individuals with LIS and respecting the rights of these individuals to
   refuse intervention. By aiding willing individuals in re-engaging with
   their physical and social worlds, BCIs open up avenues of opportunity
   taken for granted by able individuals and introduce new ways in which
   these individuals can be harmed. These latter considerations serve to
   highlight our emergent social responsibilities to those individuals who
   will be suitable for, and receive, BCIs.

AB Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has surfaced as a powerful
   method to study brain function in humans. While the involvement of
   neuroradiologists in fMRI studies in the clinical setting is obvious, in
   neuroscience research most of the investigators are not specialists
   trained in reading brain images. Advances in neuroimaging are
   increasingly intersecting with issues of ethical, legal, and social
   interest. Debate on fMRI is starting, mainly under the impetus of a new
   interdisciplinary field, neuroethics. The objective of this review is to
   bring forth reflection and discussion about ethical issues regarding
   fMRI, with emphasis to the perspective of the neuroradiologist. EMBASE
   (R) and MEDLINE (R) were searched for articles pertaining to ethics in
   fMRI, between 1991 and 2007. A total of 42 articles were retrieved, 95%
   published in the last 6 years. Only 10% were published in radiology
   journals. The major potential ethical issues identified in the reviewed
   articles concerned recruitment of vulnerable groups; informed consent;
   incidental findings; limitations of the technique, interpretation and
   validity of results; risks and safety; confidentiality and privacy; fMRI
   applications outside the laboratory (presurgical planning; diagnostic
   and predictive potential; forensic, security, military and commercial
   use); and public communication of research results. Not all the
   identified issues in this review were directly relevant to
   neuroradiologists in particular, but for sure some did.
   Neuroradiologists must find the time and energy to have an important
   role in identifying and solving ethical (and related) issues in fMRI,
   working in collaboration with ethicists, social scientists, clinicians,
   neuroscience researchers, patients, healthy volunteers, journalists,
   marketers, lawyers, and policy makers.

AB Social cognition, cognitive neuroscience, and neuroethics have reached a
   synthesis of late, but some troubling features are present. The
   neuroscience that currently dominates the study of social cognition is
   exclusively cognitive neuroscience, as contrasted with the cellular and
   increasingly molecular emphasis that has gripped mainstream neuroscience
   over the past three decades. Furthermore, the recent field of molecular
   and cellular cognition has begun to unravel some molecular mechanisms
   involved in social cognition, especially pertaining to the consolidation
   of memories of particular conspecific organisms. Some new experimental
   techniques for positive interventions into these hypothesized mechanisms
   offer opportunities for establishing direct causal linkages between
   intra-neuronal molecular events and the behaviors used to measure social
   cognitive phenomena. Predicted results from an experiment described
   below also cast doubt on the application of the "extended mind" approach
   from recent cognitive science to ground the neuroscience of social
   cognition. Since neuroethics relies heavily on our best neuroscience of
   social cognition, that field may soon need to extend its attention
   beyond cognitive neuroscience, and into neuroscience's cellular and
   molecular mainstream. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Daniel Kolak's theory of synchronic consciousness according to which the
   entire range of dissociative phenomena, from pathologies such as MPD and
   schizophrenia to normal dream states, are best explained in terms of
   consciousness becoming simultaneously identified as many selves, has
   revolutionary therapeutic implications for neurology and psychiatry. All
   these selves, according to Kolak-even the purely imaginary ones that
   exist as such only in our dreams-are not just conscious but also
   self-conscious, with beliefs, intentions, living lives informed by
   memories (confabulatory, in the case of the fictional ones) and personal
   histories. Kolak's derivation of psychiatrically relevant aspects of his
   theory-a neurological rendition of a Kantian transcendental argument-can
   be given a straightforward neurological, and therefore open to
   scientific scrutiny, interpretation that would then more easily lend
   itself to the clinical setting in which these perplexing phenomena,
   along with their purveyors, must live and cope. This will be the main
   focus of this paper.

AB Ethics, a branch of philosophy, has a place in the regulatory framework
   of human subjects research. Sometimes, however, ethical concepts and
   arguments play a more central role in scientific activity. This can
   happen, for example, when violations of research norms are also ethical
   violations. In such a situation, ethical arguments can be marshaled to
   improve the quality of the scientific research. I explore two different
   examples in which philosophers and scientists have used ethical
   arguments to plead for epistemological improvements in the conduct of
   research. The first example deals with research dishonesty in
   pharmaceutical development. The second example is concerned with
   neuropsychological research using fMRI technology.

AB Brain images are used both as scientific evidence and to illustrate the
   results of neuroimaging experiments. These images are apt to be viewed
   as photographs of brain activity, and in so viewing them people are
   prone to assume that they share the evidential characteristics of
   photographs. Photographs are epistemically compelling, and have a number
   of characteristics that underlie what I call their inferential
   proximity. Here I explore the aptness of the photography analogy, and
   argue that although neuroimaging does bear important similarities to
   photography, the details of the generation and analysis of neuroimages
   significantly complicate the relation of the image to the data.
   Neuroimages are not inferentially proximate, but their seeming so
   increases the potential for misinterpretation. This suggests caution in
   appealing to such images in the public domain.

AB In recent years, two distinct trajectories of bioethical inquiry have
   emerged: neuroethics and nanoethics. The former deals with issues in
   neuroscience, whereas the latter deals with issues in nanoscience and
   nanotechnology. In both cases, the ethical inquiries have coalesced in
   response to rapidly increasing scientific and engineering developments
   in each field. Both also present major issues for contemplation in
   bioethics. However, the questions are ( 1) how different are the ethical
   issues raised, and ( 2) is it beneficial for neuroethics and nanoethics
   inquiries to proceed on often-divergent trajectories by ethicists who
   otherwise might never interact? If, for example, ethical inquiry occurs
   only within the disciplinary confines of their predominant area(s) of
   science ( which now seems to be the case) or by overlooking prior
   discussions in other scientific realms ( like genetics), then the
   opportunity for a richer, more comprehensive discourse may be lost. I
   argue that this ( 1) is a disservice to bioethics, ( 2) is antithetical
   to some of the aims of bioethical inquiry, and ( 3) encourages the
   reductionism bioethicists' claim that is counterproductive.

AB Our ethical obligations to another being depend at least in part on that
   being's capacity for a mental life. Our usual approach to inferring the
   mental state of another is to reason by analogy: If another being
   behaves as I do in a circumstance that engenders a certain mental state
   in me, I conclude that it has engendered the same mental state in him or
   her. Unfortunately, as philosophers have long noted, this analogy is
   fallible because behavior and mental states are only contingently
   related. If the other person is acting, for example, we could draw the
   wrong conclusion about his or her mental state. In this article I
   consider another type of analogy that can be drawn between oneself and
   another to infer the mental state of the other, substituting brain
   activity for behavior. According to most current views of the mind-body
   problem, mental states and brain states are non-contingently related,
   and hence inferences drawn with the new analogy are not susceptible to
   the alternative interpretations that plague the behavioral analogy. The
   implications of this approach are explored in two cases for which
   behavior is particularly unhelpful as a guide to mental status: severely
   brain-damaged patients who are incapable of intentional communicative
   behavior, and nonhuman animals whose behavioral repertoires are
   different from ours and who lack language.

TI Which naturalism for bioethics? A defense of moderate (pragmatic)
   naturalism
SO BIOETHICS
LA English

DE naturalism; pragmatism; bioethics; neuroethics; epistemology
ID CLINICAL PRAGMATISM
AB There is a growing interest in various forms of naturalism in bioethics,
   but there is a clear need for further clarification. In an effort to
   address this situation, I present three epistemological stances:
   anti-naturalism, strong naturalism, and moderate pragmatic naturalism. I
   argue that the dominant paradigm within philosophical ethics has been a
   form of anti-naturalism mainly supported by a strong 'is' and 'ought'
   distinction. This fundamental epistemological commitment has contributed
   to the estrangement of academic philosophical ethics from major social
   problems and explains partially why, in the early 1980s, 'medicine saved
   the life of ethics'. Rejection of anti-naturalism, however, is often
   associated with strong forms of naturalism that commit the naturalistic
   fallacy and threaten to reduce the normative dimensions of ethics to
   biological imperatives. This move is rightly dismissed as a pitfall
   since ethics is, in part, a struggle against the course of nature.
   Rejection of naturalism has drawbacks, however, such as detering
   bioethicists from acknowledging the implicit naturalistic
   epistemological commitments of bioethics. I argue that a moderate
   pragmatic form of naturalism represents an epistemological position that
   best embraces the tension of anti-naturalism and strong naturalism:
   bioethics is neither disconnected from empirical knowledge nor
   subjugated to it. The discussion is based upon historical writings in
   philosophy and bioethics.

TI Women's neuroethics? Why sex matters for neuroethics
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BIOETHICS

DT Article
AB The Neuroethics Affinity Group of the American Society for Bioethics and
   Humanities (ASBH) met for the third time in October 2007 to review
   progress in the field of neuroethics and consider high-impact priorities
   for the future. Closely aligned with ASBH's own goals of recruiting
   junior scholars to bioethics and mentoring them to successful careers,
   the Neuroethics Affinity Group placed a call for new ideas to be
   presented at the Group meeting, specifically by junior attendees. One
   group responded with the idea to probe a new direction for neuroethics
   focused on the neuroscience of gender differences. In the spirit of full
   disclosure, two of the authors are a student (Chalfin) and fellow
   (Murphy) of the program I formerly directed at Stanford University. The
   third (Karkazis) is junior faculty there. The intellectual ownership of
   the ideas in the report below, however, are entirely theirs. Like lit
   torches in a juggling act, there are many directions this project can
   go. The report is a snapshot of these authors' first iteration of the
   concept of women's neuroethics. Many thanks are extended to participants
   of the ASBH Neuroethics Affinity Group meeting whose enthusiasm and
   feedback was immensely helpful in shaping the concept and moving it
   ahead.

AB The application of neuroimaging technology to the study of the injured
   brain has transformed how neuroscientists understand disorders of
   consciousness, such as the vegetative and minimally conscious states,
   and deepened our understanding of mechanisms of recovery. This
   scientific progress, and its potential clinical translation, provides an
   opportunity for ethical reflection. It was against this scientific
   backdrop that we convened a conference of leading investigators in
   neuroimaging, disorders of consciousness and neuroethics. Our goal was
   to develop an ethical frame to move these investigative techniques into
   mature clinical tools. This paper presents the recommendations and
   analysis of a Working Meeting on Ethics, Neuroimaging and Limited States
   of Consciousness held at Stanford University during June 2007. It
   represents an interdisciplinary approach to the challenges posed by the
   emerging use of neuroimaging technologies to describe and characterize
   disorders of consciousness.

AB Without exaggeration, it could be said that we are entering a golden age
   of neuroscience. Informed by recent developments in neuroimaging that
   allow us to peer into the working brain at both a structural and
   functional level, neuroscientists are beginning to untangle mechanisms
   of recovery after brain injury and grapple with age-old questions about
   brain and mind and their correlates neural mechanisms and consciousness.
   Neuroimaging, coupled with new diagnostic categories and assessment
   scales are helping us develop a new diagnostic nosology about disorders
   of consciousness which will likely improve prognostication and suggest
   therapeutic advances. Historically such diagnostic refinement has yield
   therapeutic advances in medicine and there is no reason to doubt that
   this will be the case for disorders of consciousness, perhaps bringing
   relief to a marginalized population now on the periphery of the
   therapeutic agenda. In spite of this promise, the translation of
   research findings into the clinical context will be difficult. As we
   move from descriptive categories about disorders of consciousness, like
   the vegetative or minimally conscious states, to ones further specified
   by integrating behavioral and neuroimaging findings, humility not hubris
   should be the virtue that guides the ethical conduct of research and
   practice.

AB There is considerable interest in the use of neuroimaging techniques for
   forensic purposes. Memory detection techniques, including the
   well-publicized Brain Fingerprinting technique (Brain Fingerprinting
   Laboratories, Inc., SeattleWA), exploit the fact that the brain responds
   differently to sensory stimuli to which it has been exposed before. When
   a stimulus is specifically associated with a crime, the resulting brain
   activity should differentiate between someone who was present at the
   crime and someone who was not. This article reviews the scientific
   literature on three such techniques: priming, old/new, and P300 effects.
   The forensic potential of these techniques is evaluated based on four
   criteria: specificity, automaticity, encoding flexibility, and
   longevity. This article concludes that none of the techniques are devoid
   of forensic potential, although much research is yet to be done. Ethical
   issues, including rights to privacy and against self-incrimination, are
   discussed. A discussion of legal issues concludes that current memory
   detection techniques do not yet meet United States standards of legal
   admissibility.

AB It has been suggested that the recent rapid developments in the fields
   of neuroscience and psychopharmacology have increased the possibilities
   for pharmacological enhancement of mental functioning. Here, evidence is
   reviewed which shows that drugs acting on a variety of neurotransmitter
   systems can indeed enhance cognition, and to a lesser extent mood and
   pro-social behavior. Moreover, it seems possible to interfere with the
   (re)consolidation of traumatic memories. There are, however, a number of
   caveats: first, as cognition-enhancing drugs can simultaneously exert
   both linear and quadratic (U-shaped) effects, doses most effective in
   facilitating one behavior could at the same time exert null or even
   detrimental effects on other cognitive domains. Second, individuals with
   a 'low memory span' might benefit from cognition-enhancing drugs,
   whereas 'high span subjects' are 'overdosed'. And finally, evidence
   suggests that a number of trade-offs could occur. For example, increases
   of cognitive stability might come at the cost of a decreased capacity to
   flexibly alter behavior. A short overview of ethical issues raised by
   the use of cognition and mood enhancing drugs demonstrates the
   tremendous variety in views and opinions regarding the subject. (C) 2008

   studies in which they are given their drug of addiction. We review the
   case for doing such research, and the arguments that addiction does, and
   does not, prevent addicted persons from consenting to such research. We
   argue for a more nuanced view that acknowledges that while in some
   situations addiction impairs decision-making capacity, it does not
   eliminate such capacity. We conclude with some suggestions for
   recruiting addicted subjects and designing experiments in ways to obtain
   free and informed consent.

AB Issues of disclosure arise in neuroscientific research during the

   and when study results are generated. The possibility of disclosure of
   incidental findings and/or research results may raise informational
   expectations on the part of subjects and may alter a study's risk:

   this potential consequence of research participation, and specify the

   provisions for helping subjects make sense of the information to be

AB Deception in human subject research is neither uncommon nor prohibited.
   The use of deception in the recruitment phase of clinical research has
   received relatively little attention. Given that informed consent is
   foundational to human subject research, the practice of misrepresenting
   the study purpose in clinical research would seem to contradict one of
   the fundamental tenets of ethical human subjects research. Using the
   example of prodromal psychosis, this article the ethical and legal
   implications of deception in recruitment and the sufficiency of current
   guidance on the practice when the study involves a stigmatizing
   condition, the collection of genetic samples, or both. I conclude that
   when these two elements are present, deception should only be used when
   absolutely necessary and, if used, researchers should be required to
   debrief participants before the collection of genetic samples and give
   particular attention to minimizing risks of privacy breaches.

   that the small amount of available neuroethics literature related to
   public engagement has principally discussed only communication/education
   or made calls for dialogue without exploring what this might entail on a

   examples-salmon, biobanks, and neuroethics-to consider and clarify the

AB Purpose of review
   Neuroimaging is providing a window on severe brain injury and mechanisms
   of recovery in patients with consciousness disorders. This brief essay
   will consider the ethical implications of these developments for
   clinical diagnosis, emerging therapeutics and health policy.
   Recent findings
   Over the past year, functional imaging has led to two dramatic findings
   with the potential to alter how clinicians categorize severe brain
   injury and understand mechanisms of recovery. One paper reported a
   neuroimaging response in a patient who was behaviorally in the
   vegetative state. Another described structural changes in a patient with
   late emergence from the minimally conscious state.
   Summary
   Research into functional imaging and disorders of consciousness have the
   potential to elucidate mechanisms of brain recovery and refine their
   diagnostic nosology. These distinctions are becoming increasingly
   important given the potential of emerging therapeutic approaches to the
   minimally conscious state. Despite this promise the refinement of
   descriptive categories such as the vegetative and minimally conscious
   states is not without some degree of peril. Investigators and clinicians
   need to appreciate the uncertainty that will be engendered as diagnostic
   categories are redrawn and resist the premature dissemination of
   neuroimaging technology before its ethical implications for clinical
   practice are well understood.

AB In recent years, the study of decision making has provided a
   paradigmatic case of "crossbreeding" of different disciplines. The
   integration of economics, psychology and neurosciences within
   neuroeconomics calls for more accurate and comprehensive models of human
   rationality, which may be obtained by combining diverse theoretical
   approaches and experimental techniques. In this respect, neuroeconomics
   contributes to a naturalistic, brain-based, explanation of human agency.
   However, although contemporary naturalism insists on the unitary aspect
   of reality, we stress that supporting unitary study of nature is not the
   same as supporting a single, fundamental discipline to which all
   higher-order analyses could (or should) be reduced. We argue for
   integration, rather than reduction, as the best approach to a
   naturalistic explanation of human decision making, and we claim that
   supporting epistemological pluralism does not mean being committed to
   any specific ontological position. However, we suggest that an
   "emergentist" ontology is the best candidate to integrate the
   epistemological analysis here endorsed.

AB This paper presents different conceptions of neuroethics, focusing both
   on applications of neuroscience aiming to provide access to other
   people's minds and on the theoretical study of the neural bases of moral
   judgement and decision making. It is argued that these studies have not
   yet seriously undermined the traditional view of humans as moral free
   agents, nor have they accomplished the radical naturalisation of ethics
   that is sometimes promised or predicted. A few implications for
   normative ethics and moral epistemology are also discussed.

AB The extended mind thesis is the claim that mental states extend beyond
   the skulls of the agents whose states they are. This seemingly obscure
   and bizarre claim has far-reaching implications for neuroethics, I
   argue. In the first half of this article, I sketch the extended mind
   thesis and defend it against criticisms. In the second half, I turn to
   its neuroethical implications. I argue that the extended mind thesis
   entails the falsity of the claim that interventions into the brain are
   especially problematic just because they are internal interventions, but
   that many objections to such interventions rely, at least in part, on
   this claim. Further, I argue that the thesis alters the focus of
   neuroethics, away from the question of whether we ought to allow
   interventions into the mind, and toward the question of which
   interventions we ought to allow and under what conditions. The extended
   mind thesis dramatically expands the scope of neuroethics: because
   interventions into the environment of agents can count as interventions
   into their minds, decisions concerning such interventions become
   questions for neuroethics.

AB Understanding why we produce labels for neuropsychiatric conditions,
   such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and how we use those words to tell
   stories about our brain, as well as which groups control such diagnostic
   discourse, is important to a wise understanding of our cognitive
   abilities, their limitations, and even our very human nature. Here, we
   explore the history and current focus of a newly emerging field called
   neuroethics and explore its relationship (or lack thereof) to a newly
   created clinical syndrome called involuntary emotional expressive
   disorder (IEED). The main argument concerns the lack of neuroethical
   discussion of issues pertinent to social influences on disease and the
   construction of professional specialization. We are critical of the
   processes associated with the creation of both the field and the
   syndrome, and express concern about their eventual outcomes. The
   interaction of social, political, and business institutions, the
   inherent interests of the advancement of larger research projects (and
   the individuals that compose them), their potential for profit, and
   other incentives to enhance marketability and public attention toward
   certain research programs will be examined as we discuss the development
   of the field of neuroethics. Similarly, we argue that these social
   factors and forces are instrumental in the development of IEED as a
   recognizable category and condition. Our critique is guided by the hope
   that through such analyses we can improve our understanding of how we go
   about our academic activities in cognitive neuroscience and also improve
   our efforts to help people suffering from neuropsychiatric conditions,
   such as dementia.

   provide an overview of the current landscape for neuroimaging and
   discuss specific research ethics topics arising from it. We suggest
   preliminary approaches to tackle current issues, and identify areas for

AB Culture and public opinion strongly influence debates on ethics-and what
   may be ethically acceptable to one nationality may be unacceptable to
   others. In military operations, some cognitive performance enhancement
   technologies are more ethically controversial than others. Of the
   enhancement technologies, use of psychoactive pharmaceuticals to alter
   behavior in healthy humans possibly presents the most controversial
   ethical challenge. Discussion of the bioethics of psychoactive
   enhancement agents is advisable because their military use is increasing
   while doctrine for their use remains limited. This paper focuses on
   psychoactive pharmaceuticals to enhance cognitive performance of
   military members. The topics addressed include: the use of psychoactive
   pharmaceuticals within a coalition framework; if ethical circumstances
   do exist for their use, what are these circumstances in clear and
   operationally useful terms; and guidelines to aid leaders in making
   ethically acceptable decisions. These questions should be answered: 1)
   Is use truly informed and voluntary - e.g., is an individual soldier
   requesting the medication with full understanding of its primary effects
   and side effects; 2) Is the medication safe for use in this individual,
   and safe within the context of the operational environment?; 3) Is the
   use of the medication consistent with its dosage and pharmacological
   function - is a sleep-inducing medication being used at appropriate
   doses, for a specified period, to facilitate sleep; and 4) Have
   available non-pharmacologic alternatives been fully utilized? This paper
   addresses a very narrow segment of the larger bioethics discussion: the
   use of pharmacologic enhancing agents in military members in times of
   war or national emergency.

AB It is normal for military authorities to seek performance advantages
   over their adversaries. When the search for such advantages posits the
   use of pharmacologic means to improve human performance, medical
   officers may be asked to provide advice, or even pressured to prescribe
   a particular drug. Dr. Russo has examined the ethical aspects of this
   intervention in the specific case of combating the degrading effects of
   fatigue, and has developed a four-question framework to assist medical
   personnel in judging the ethical acceptability of such intervention.
   This commentary congratulates Dr. Russo for bringing an important
   question into the open, and for the practicality of his approach, but
   argues for physicians to exercise great caution in carrying out this
   function. There are biases that will predictably affect relative risk
   perception and decision making in this area; medical officers must be
   prepared to counteract these biases through education and through
   challenging assumptions. Military medical leaders must be prepared to
   guide their junior medical officers, and to intervene with line
   commanders when command decisions cause ethical discomfort.

AB This commentary provides a human performance perspective on the
   question: Should there be a battle over the use of cognitive enhancement
   technologies in war? In trying to answer this question Russo presents a
   psycho-medical model with four guiding questions for the ethical use of
   cogniceuticals, psycho-active pharmaceuticals, which are likely to
   enhance cognitive performance. In examining two examples of modern
   warfare with his guiding questions, he concludes that a war on the use
   of cognitive enhancement technologies in war is not always necessary. in
   this commentary three additional points of view are discussed. Firstly,
   a human performance perspective on manned weapon systems is presented,
   next to Russo's psycho-medical model. From this human performance
   perspective it is recommended to make military personnel and their
   commanders aware of the detrimental effects of fatigue and exhaustion on
   vigilance and decision making. Secondly, the quality of life of military
   personnel is introduced as a criterion for the ethical use of
   cogniceuticals. It appears that performance and quality of life can be
   addressed simultaneously in manned weapon systems. Thirdly, it is
   recommended to continue the discussion on ethical use of cogniceuticals
   by feeding it with empirical data from randomized controlled trial
   studies, in stead of examining cases and logical reasoning only.

AB From the early 1990s and onwards, the Danish military has been
   increasingly active in the hot spots of the world as part of UN or
   coalition forces, for example, in the Balkans, Africa, Iraq, and
   Afghanistan. This has also included deployment of an F-16 unit in
   relation to the conflicts in Kosovo and Afghanistan, where the pilots
   had to cope with very long missions in a single seat fighter. It is well
   known in the fighter community that at least one nation has a policy to
   issue amphetamines for this use, when missions are foreseen to last more
   than a set number of hours, etc., and it was necessary to decide whether
   the Danish military should adopt a similar policy. As a result of this
   process, the use of caffeine tablets was approved for aircrew on
   long-duration missions a couple of years ago, and that is still the only
   substance used as a pharmacological fatigue countermeasure during
   military air operations. In addition to this, all non-pharmacological
   measures are pursued as much as possible, such as good sleep and rest
   planning, proper nutrition, etc. Concerning amphetamines, the conclusion
   was that their use in any planned military activity (including
   long-duration single seat F-16 missions over Kosovo and Afghanistan) is
   not possible under Danish law. The administration of amphetamines for
   any other use (except clear emergency/survival situations) would be a
   violation of the legislation concerning illegal drugs. it would also be
   considered as clearly unethical behavior on the part of the physician.

AB The human rules and values of our common western democratic society must
   be obeyed in context with legal and ethical aspects, as well as in an
   operational military environment. Even though there may be particular
   exceptional circumstances, the forced use of cogniceuticals is contrary
   to our values, and also contrary to effective cross-cultural
   considerations in a multinational battlefield. it is very problematic to
   define methods for studies to evaluate the efficiency and safety of
   cogniceuticals in complex and extreme operational situations. It is not
   clear whether a cumulative use/self-medication will have significant
   impact on cognitive performance and personality. The long-term effects
   may not be foreseen. An important aspect you mentioned is that
   application of a cogniceutical agent to restore function is not
   enhancement but rather sustainment within a homeostatic balance. As
   flight surgeons and medical officers, it is our special obligation to
   provide the best medical service for the welfare of our aircrew and
   soldiers during all phases of missions and deployments. Applying
   pharmacological agents is unjustifiable due to ethical and moral
   reasons, especially when it has been tried in the past, in an apparently
   voluntary nature. The German position is that only caffeine, with its
   high therapeutic index, is acceptable to maintain sustainability in an
   operational environment. Other enhancing drugs are strictly forbidden
   and also not approved by Federal authorities as medications for this
   indication.

AB Recent technologies and developments in neuroscience have contributed to
   remarkable scientific discoveries, and have also raised many new
   philosophical, ethical, legal, and social issues. Research in
   "neuroethics" has identified various ethical issues, which will be
   difficult for current biomedical ethics to resolve from both an
   experimental and a social perspective, such as criminal applications of
   brain scans, incidental findings during non-clinical brain imaging, and
   cognitive enhancement. Although American and European neuroscience
   societies have demonstrated immediate, concrete reactions to these
   ethical issues, including academic conferences, study programs, and
   publications, Japanese neuroscientists have so far produced little
   response. Ethics is tightly linked with one's religion, nationality,
   culture, and social background, whereas science is tightly linked with
   the demand, economics, and politics of the society to which individuals
   belong. Taken together, it is important and necessary for Japanese
   neuroscientists to consider the ethical problems in Japanese
   neuroscience. In this paper, we first review the history of neuroethics
   in the world, and then report the less-developed ethical issues in the
   Japanese neuroscience community, focusing on neuroimaging and
   manipulative neuroscience as a first step in discussing how to apply
   principles in neuroethics to this rapidly progressing field of research.

AB This article focuses on the prospects and ethics of using neuroimaging
   to predict Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is motivated by consideration of
   the historical roles of science in medicine and society, and
   considerations specifically contemporary of capabilities in imaging and
   aging, and the benefits and hope they bring. A general consensus is that
   combinations of imaging methods will ultimately be most fruitful in
   predicting disease. Their roll-out into translational practice will not
   be free of complexity, however, as culture and values differ in terms of
   what defines benefit and risk, who will benefit and who is at risk, what
   methods must be in place to assure the maximum safety, comfort, and
   protection of subjects and patients, and educational and policy needs.
   Proactive planning for the ethical and societal implications of
   predicting diseases of the aging brain is critical and will benefit all
   stakeholders-researchers, patients and families, health care providers,
   and policy makers.

AB There are few available resources for learning and teaching about
   ethical issues in neuroimaging research with children, who constitute a
   special and vulnerable population. Here, a brief review of ethical
   issues in developmental research, situated within the emerging field of
   neuroethics, highlights the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of
   research with children. Traditional boundaries between behavioural,
   psychological, neuroscientific and educational research are being
   blurred by multidisciplinary studies of learning and human development.
   Developmental and educational researchers need to be aware of the
   ethical quandaries inherent in such research, and moral educators need
   to encourage researchers to consider the ethical aspects of
   developmental neuroimaging. To this end, fictional case scenarios were
   designed to address two topics in the ethical conduct of neuroimaging
   research with children: inadvertent findings in paediatric neuroimaging
   and inclusion of young children in pharmacological clinical trials. The
   latter is contrasted with an educational trial in an alternate scenario,
   underscoring similarities in ethical issues across types of
   developmental research. It is hoped that discussions elicited by such
   scenarios will contribute to both moral education and paediatric
   neuroethics.

SO SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE

DT Article
DE antisocial; psychopathy; moral; prefrontal; temporal
AB A common feature of the antisocial, rule-breaking behavior that is
   central to criminal, violent and psychopathic individuals is the failure
   to follow moral guidelines. This review summarizes key findings from
   brain imaging research on both antisocial behavior and moral reasoning,
   and integrates these findings into a neural moral model of antisocial
   behavior. Key areas found to be functionally or structurally impaired in
   antisocial populations include dorsal and ventral regions of the
   prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala, hippocampus, angular gyrus, anterior
   cingulate and temporal cortex. Regions most commonly activated in moral
   judgment tasks consist of the polar/medial and ventral PFC, amygdala,
   angular gyrus and posterior cingulate. It is hypothesized that the
   rule-breaking behavior common to antisocial, violent and psychopathic
   individuals is in part due to impairments in some of the structures
   (dorsal and ventral PFC, amygdala and angular gyrus) subserving moral
   cognition and emotion. Impairments to the emotional component that
   comprises the feeling of what is moral is viewed as the primary deficit
   in antisocials, although some disruption to the cognitive and
   cognitive-emotional components of morality (particularly
   self-referential thinking and emotion regulation) cannot be ruled out.
   While this neurobiological predisposition is likely only one of several
   biosocial processes involved in the etiology of antisocial behavior, it
   raises significant moral issues for the legal system and neuroethics.

AB Purpose of review The study gives an overview of ethical questions
   raised by the progress of neuroscience in identifying and intervening in
   neural correlates of the mind.
   Recent findings Ethical problems resulting from brain research have
   induced the emergence of a new discipline termed neuroethics. Critical
   questions concern issues, such as prediction of disease,
   psychopharmacological enhancement of attention, memory or mood, and
   technologies such as psychosurgery, deep-brain stimulation or brain
   implants. Such techniques are. capable of affecting the individual's
   sense of privacy, autonomy and identity. Moreover, reductionist
   interpretations of neuroscientific results challenge notions of free
   will, responsibility, personhood and the self which are essential for
   western culture and society. They may also gradually change psychiatric
   concepts of mental health and illness. These tendencies call for
   thorough, philosophically informed analyses of research findings and
   critical evaluation of their underlying conceptions of humans.
   Summary Advances in neuroscience raise ethical, social and legal issues
   in relation to the human person and the brain. Potential benefits of
   applying neuroimaging, psychopharmacology and neurotechnology to
   mentally ill and healthy persons have to be carefully weighed against
   their potential harm. Questions concerning underlying concepts of humans
   should be actively dealt with by interdisciplinary and public debate.

ID TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; BRAIN; DEPRESSION
AB Neuroethics, a recently modernized field at the intersection of
   bioethics and neuroscience, is founded on centuries of discussion of the
   ethical issues associated with mind and behavior. Broadly defined,
   neuroethics is concerned with ethical, legal and social policy
   implications of neuroscience, and with aspects of neuroscience research
   itself. Advances in neuroscience increasingly challenge long-held views
   of the self and the individual's relationship to society. Neuroscience
   also has led to innovations in clinical medicine that have not only
   therapeutic but also non-therapeutic dimensions that extend well beyond
   previously charted boundaries. The exponential increase in
   cross-disciplinary research, the commercialization of cognitive
   neuroscience, the impetus for training in ethics, and the increased
   attention being paid to public understanding of science all illuminate
   the important role of neuroethics in neuroscience.

AB Recent developments in neuroscience raise the worry that understanding
   how brains cause behavior will undermine our views about free will and,
   consequently, about moral responsibility. The potential ethical
   consequences of such a result are sweeping. I provide three reasons to
   think that these worries seemingly inspired by neuroscience are
   misplaced. First, problems for common-sense notions of freedom exist
   independently of neuroscientific advances. Second, neuroscience is not
   in a position to undermine our intuitive notions. Third, recent
   empirical studies suggest that even if people do misconstrue
   neuroscientific results as relevant to our notion of freedom, our
   judgments of moral responsibility will remain largely unaffected. These
   considerations suggest that neuroethical concerns about challenges to
   our conception of freedom are misguided.

AB Objective: The authors examined the ethical and practical management
   issues resulting from the detection of incidental abnormal findings on
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research studies in healthy pediatric
   volunteers. Method: A retrospective examination of the findings from 60
   clinical reports of research MRI scans from a cohort of healthy
   pediatric volunteers (ages 10-21) was conducted. Results: A
   neuroradiologist noted incidental abnormalities in 8 (13%) of 60
   subjects. Of these eight children, three (5%) adolescents were found to
   have abnormalities (possible tumor, possible vascular malformation, and
   unidentified bright object in white matter, respectively) that were
   judged to require further diagnostic workup. In the first two cases,
   follow-up MRI ruled out the possibility of a tumor or vascular
   malformation. In the third case, a follow-up MRI 24 months later found
   that the white matter abnormality remained stable and was thus deemed to
   be of no clinical significance. Conclusions: In healthy children who are
   participating in research MRI protocols, it is ethically difficult to
   determine whether films should be read clinically. Based on this
   retrospective analysis, there would have been no risk(s) associated with
   not reading the films. In contrast, considerable anxiety was generated
   as a consequence of having the scans clinically read by a
   neuroradiologist because of the reporting of incidental abnormalities
   that later turned out to be false positives. Also, the detection of no
   abnormality on a research-quality scan could imply erroneously to some
   subjects that no abnormality was present, which may have been falsely
   reassuring.

AB Neuroscience represents a dynamic area of biomedical research where
   neuroethical responsibilities for researchers are emerging. This paper
   is the companion piece to the French-language one also published in this
   issue of the Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences. It serves as a
   review of recent advances in neuroethics through the lens of three
   cases: (1) incidental finding of anomalies in neuroimaging research; (2)
   creation of neurotechnologies that can lead to cognitive enhancement,
   and (3) responsible communication of research results. We propose and
   discuss a multidimensional framework of neuroethical responsibilities to
   help tackle these issues. The framework reiterates the fundamental role
   of scientific integrity, puts in the foreground social responsibilities
   pertaining to the eventual use of neuroscience knowledge, and highlights
   self-reflection in research and training of researchers.

DE neuroethics; neuroimaging; policy
AB As one of the most compelling technologies for imaging the brain,
   functional MRI (fMRI) produces measurements and persuasive pictures of
   research subjects making cognitive judgments and even reasoning through
   difficult moral decisions. Even after centuries of studying the link
   between brain and behavior, this capability presents a number of novel
   significant questions. For example, what are the implications of
   biologizing human experience? How might neuroimaging disrupt the
   mysteries of human nature, spirituality, and personal identity? Rather
   than waiting for an ethical agenda to emerge from some unpredictable
   combination of the concerns of ethicists and researchers, the attention
   of journalists, or after controversy is sparked by research that cannot
   be retracted, we queried key figures in bioethics and the humanities,
   neuroscience, media, industry, and patient advocacy in focus groups and
   interviews. We identified specific ethical, legal and social issues
   (ELSI) that highlight researcher obligations and the nonclinical impact
   of the technology at this new frontier.

AB Progress in neuroscience will allow us to reveal the neuronal correlates
   of psychological processes involved in ethically relevant notions such
   as informed consent. Informed consent involves decision making, the
   psychological and neural processes of which have been investigated
   extensively in neuroscience. The neuroscience of decision making may be
   able to contribute to an ethics of informed consent by providing
   empirical and thus descriptive criteria. Since, however, descriptive
   criteria must be distinguished from normative criteria, the neuroscience
   of decision making cannot replace the ethics of informed consent.
   Instead, the neuroscience of decision making could complement the
   current ethics, resulting in what can be called neuroethics of informed
   consent. It is concluded that current progress in the neurosciences
   could complement and change the way in which we approach ethical
   problems in neuropsychiatry.

AB Purpose: To explore subjects' attitudes and expectations concerning the
   detection and management of incidental findings in neuroimaging
   research.
   Materials and Methods: Healthy control subjects (N = 105) who previously
   participated in neuroinraging studies in medical and nonmedical settings
   were surveyed about their expectations and attitudes toward unexpected
   clinical findings on their research brain scans. We hypothesized that
   even though the participants consented to a scanning procedure for
   research purposes alone, they would still expect pathology, if present,
   to be detected and reported to them.
   Results: Fifty-four percent of participants reported that they expected
   research scans to detect abnormalities if they existed. Nearly all
   subjects (> 90%) reported that they would want findings communicated to
   them, and many (59%) preferred this to be done by a physician affiliated
   with the research team. The participants responded in similar ways
   whether they were scanned in medical or nonmedical settings.
   Conclusion: Clarity about procedures for handling incidental findings
   when obtaining written and verbal informed consent is essential to
   ensure that the subjects' expectations are consistent with the purpose
   and scope of the research.

AB Neuroimaging, psychosurgery, deep-brain stimulation, and
   psychopharmacology hold considerable promise for more accurate
   prediction and diagnosis and more effective treatment of neurological
   and psychiatric disorders. Some forms of psychopharmacology may even be
   able to enhance normal cognitive and affective capacities. But the brain
   remains the most complex and least understood of all the organs in the
   human body. Mapping the neural correlates of the mind through brain
   scans, and altering these correlates through surgery, stimulation, or
   pharmacological interventions can affect us in both positive and
   negative ways. We need to carefully weigh the potential benefit against
   the potential harm of such techniques. This paper examines some of these
   techniques and explores the emerging ethical issues in clinical
   neuroscience.

AB Progress in neuroscience leads not only to novel therapeutic
   opportunities but also raises several ethical problems. These problems
   are often subsumed under the term "neuroethics," of which the definition
   and purpose often remain unclear. We discuss the problems of informed
   consent, free will, sense of self, and personality in light of recent
   neuroscientific progress. Due to distinct categories and frames of
   reference, these philosophical-ethical terms cannot be limited only to
   the brain; the development of systematic relations is suggested. This
   accounts for the "special ethical position of the brain." It is
   concluded that only this sense can neuroethics account for the ethical
   complexity in neuropsychiatric disorders.

   modulating the brain with TMS through the research,ethics lens and in
   clinical medicine for treating frank pathology, primarily in psychiatric
   diseases. We also consider contemporary issues raised in the neuroethics
   literature about managing unexpected findings, and relate these to TMS
   and to other frontier neurotechnology that is becoming openly available
   in the public domain. We argue that safety and informed consent are of
   paramount importance for TMS, but that personal values and sociocultural
   factors must also be considered when examining the promise of this
   technology and applications that ought to be highlighted for extra
   precautions.

   of research and intervention. Due to their far-reaching medical, social
   and anthropological implications they raise new ethical issues regarding
   their goals and legitimacy. The "neuroethical evaluative matrix", which
   is presented in this article, provides an ethical orientation in
   neuroscientific research and clinical interventions. Its practicability
   is demonstrated for the following central neuroethical fields:
   neuroscientific research, neural grafting, psychopharmacology,
   neuroirnaging, neuro- and psychosurgery, and allocation in neuroscience.
   It will turn out that the neuroethical matrix provides a systematic and
   practical possibility to obtain a normative reference frame in
   neuroscience and neurology.

ID RITALIN
AB The use of Ritalin and other stimulant drug treatments for
   attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) raises distinctive moral
   dilemmas for parents; these moral dilemmas have not been adequately
   addressed in the bioethics literature. This paper draws upon data from a
   qualitative empirical study to investigate parents' use of the moral
   ideal of authenticity as part of their narrative justifications for
   dosing decisions and actions. I show that therapeutic decisions and
   actions are embedded in valued cultural ideals about masculinity,
   self-actualization and success, as well as in moral conceptions of
   authenticity and personal freedom. I argue that this investigation of
   parents' moral justifications and dosing dilemmas raises questions about
   the validity of authenticity as a transcendent moral principle.
   Moreover, this study demonstrates that in order to be relevant,
   bioethical analysis of neurocognitive enhancement must engage with
   ground-up studies of moral principles and decision-making in context.

AB Detection of deception and confirmation of truth telling with
   conventional polygraphy raised a host of technical and ethical issues.
   Recently, newer methods of recording electromagnetic signals from the
   brain show promise in permitting the detection of deception or truth
   telling. Some are even being promoted as more accurate than conventional
   polygraphy. While the new technologies raise issues of personal privacy,
   acceptable forensic application, and other social issues, the focus of
   this paper is the technical limitations of the developing technology.
   Those limitations include the measurement validity of the new
   technologies, which remains largely unknown. Another set of questions
   pertains to the psychological paradigms used to model or constrain the
   target behavior. Finally, there is little standardization in the field,
   and the vulnerability of the techniques to countermeasures is unknown.
   Premature application of these technologies outside of research settings
   should be resisted, and the social conversation about the appropriate
   parameters of its civil, forensic, and security use should begin.

DT Article

   CORTEX; FACES; RACE; MIND
AB From a twenty-first century partnership between bioethics and
   neuroscience, the modern field of neuroethics is emerging, and
   technologies enabling functional neuroimaging with unprecedented
   sensitivity have brought new ethical, social and legal issues to the
   forefront. Some issues, akin to those surrounding modern genetics, raise
   critical questions regarding prediction of disease, privacy and
   identity. However, with new and still-evolving insights into our
   neurobiology and previously unquantifiable features of profoundly
   personal behaviors such as social attitude, value and moral agency, the
   difficulty of carefully and properly interpreting the relationship
   between brain findings and our own self-concept is unprecedented.
   Therefore, while the ethics of genetics provides a legitimate starting
   point-even a backbone-for tackling ethical issues in neuroimaging, they
   do not suffice. Drawing on recent neuroimaging findings and their
   plausible real-world applications, we argue that interpretation of
   neuroimaging data is a key epistemological and ethical challenge. This
   challenge is two-fold. First, at the scientific level, the sheer
   complexity of neuroscience research poses challenges for integration of
   knowledge and meaningful interpretation of data. Second, at the social
   and cultural level, we find that interpretations of imaging studies are
   bound by cultural and anthropological frameworks. In particular, the
   introduction of concepts of self and personhood in neuroimaging
   illustrates the interaction of interpretation levels and is a major
   reason why ethical reflection on genetics will only partially help
   settle neuroethical issues. Indeed, ethical interpretation of such
   findings will necessitate not only traditional bioethical input but also
   a wider perspective on the construction of scientific knowledge.

AB In comparison with the ethical issues surrounding molecular genetics,
   there has been little public awareness of the ethical implications of
   neuroscience. Yet recent progress in cognitive neuroscience raises a
   host of ethical issues of at least comparable importance. Some are of a
   practical nature, concerning the applications of neurotechnology and
   their likely implications for individuals and society. Others are more
   philosophical, concerning the way we think about ourselves as persons,
   moral agents and spiritual beings. This article reviews key examples of
   each type of issue, including the relevant advances in science and
   technology and their accompanying social and philosophical problems.

AB Unraveling the mysteries of consciousness, lost and regained, and
   perhaps even intervening so as to prompt recovery are advances for which
   neither the clinical nor the Jay community are prepared. These advances
   will shake existing expectations about severe brain damage and will find
   an unprepared clinical context, perhaps even one inhospitable to what
   should clearly be viewed as important advances. This could be the
   outcome of this line of inquiry, if this exceptionally imaginative
   research can continue at all. This work faces a restrictive research
   environment that has the potential to imperil it. Added to the
   complexity of the scientific challenges that must be overcome is the
   societal context in which these investigations must occur. Research on
   human consciousness goes to the heart of our humanity and asks us to
   grapple with fundamental questions about the self. Added to this is the
   regulatory complexity of research on subjects who may be unable to
   provide their own consent because of impaired decision-making capacity,
   itself a function of altered or impaired consciousness. These factors
   can lead to a restrictive view of research that can favor risk aversion
   over discovery. In this paper, I attempt to explain systematically some
   of these challenges. I suggest,that some of the resistance might be
   tempered if we view the needs of patients with severe brain injury
   through the prism of palliative care and adopt that field's ethos and
   methods when caring for and conducting research on individuals with
   severe brain damage and disorders of consciousness. To make this
   argument I draw upon the American pragmatic tradition and utilize
   clinical pragmatism, a method of moral problem-solving that my
   colleagues and I have developed to address ethical challenges in
   clinical care and research.

   IRB protocol requirements, and neuroradiologist involvement.
   Results: Seventy-four investigators who conduct MRI studies in the
   United States and abroad responded. Eighty-two percent (54/66) reported
   discovering incidental findings in their studies, such as arteriovenous
   malformations, brain tumors, and developmental abnormalities.
   Substantial variability was found in the procedures for handling and
   communicating findings to subjects, neuroradiologist involvement,
   personnel permitted to operate equipment, and training.
   Conclusion: Guidelines for minimum and optimum standards for detecting
   and communicating incidental findings on brain MRI research are needed.

AB In this article I will explore societal reluctance towards
   neuromodulation by considering the earlier debate over psychosurgery. To
   that end, I will review the history of electrical stimulation of the
   brain and how early efforts coalesced into current day neurmodulation in
   both the clinical and research contexts. With this background, I will
   argue that the psychosurgery debate, though reflective of the societal
   turmoil of the 1960's and 70's, was also implicitly a discussion about
   the explanatory power of biological models to explain human
   consciousness and emotion and ultimately philosophical questions about
   free will and determinism. Deconstructing these lessons from the
   psychosurgery debate can help us better acknowledge advances in the
   neurosciences while avoiding both sweeping biological reductionism and
   overreaching determinism. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Developers of NBIC (Nano-Bio-Info-Cogno) technologies face a multitude
   of obstacles, not the least of which is navigating the public ethics of
   their applied research. Biotechnologies have received widespread media
   attention and spawned heated interest in their perceived social
   implications. Now, in view of the rapidly expanding purview of
   neuroscience and the growing array of technologic developments capable
   of affecting or monitoring cognition, the emerging field of neuroethics
   calls for a consideration of the social and ethical implications of
   neuroscientific discoveries and trends. To negotiate the complex ethical
   issues at stake in new and emerging kinds of technologies for improving
   human cognition, we need to overcome political, disciplinary, and
   religious sectarianism. We need analytical models that protect values of
   personhood at the heart of a functional democracy-values that allow, as
   much as possible, for individual decision-making, despite
   transformations in our understanding and ability to manipulate cognitive
   processes. Addressing cognitive enhancement from the legal and ethical
   notion of "cognitive liberty" provides a powerful tool for assessing and
   encouraging NBIC developments.

AB To illuminate the societal implications of NBIC (nano-bio-infocogno)
   technologies it is critical to place them within a broad historical
   context. By viewing recent human history as a series of techno-economic
   waves with accompanying socio-political responses, a framework emerges
   that can be used to understand how business, politics, and human culture
   will be affected by NBIC technologies. One important development that
   the NBIC convergence is making possible is neurotechnology, the set of
   tools that can influence the human central nervous system, especially
   the brain. The diffusion of neurotechnology will give rise to a new type
   of human society-a post-industrial, post-informational neurosociety.

AB The past decade has seen growing interest in the use of functional brain
   imaging methods in research. The range of conditions and behaviours
   studied using these methods has also been expanding. These developments
   have changed the profile of subfields in both psychology and
   neuroscience. While these events have been critiqued as reductionist
   moves, I argue that they can better be characterized as productive
   processes. Such a characterization makes visible the expansion and
   reorganization of the object of study and of domains of investigation;
   it highlights new relations with other disciplines and institutions, and
   it problematizes the subsequent increased social visibility. A reflexive
   approach to mapping practices is proposed to help functional imaging
   research address issues of methodological isolation and accountability.

AB Recent functional neuroimaging studies suggest that ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), left posterior superior temporal sulcus
   (pSTS) and posterior cingulate cortex are engaged during moral
   decision-making on complex dilemmatic or salient emotional stimuli. In
   this fMRI study we investigated which of these brain regions are
   activated during simple ethical decision-making about unambiguous
   scenarios not containing direct bodily harm or violence. Simple moral
   decisions compared to semantic decisions resulted in activation of left
   pSTS and middle temporal gyrus, bilateral temporal poles, left lateral
   PFC and bilateral vmPFC. These results suggest that pSTS and vmPFC are a
   common neuronal substrate of decision-making about complex ethical
   dilemmas, processing material evocative of moral emotions and simple
   ethical decision-making about scenarios devoid of violence and direct
   bodily harm.

AB The last decades of the twentieth century saw the rise of modern
   genetics. Now, many regard the initial decades of the twenty-first
   century as an era that promises explosive growth in our knowledge of the
   brain. Just as ethical issues have been a part of discourse in genetics
   from the outset, we are now paying attention to ethics in neuroscience.
   But whereas the ethics of genetics was in many ways a new conversation,
   the philosophical discussion of mental function and behaviour is an
   ancient tradition that both informs and complicates the emerging field
   of neuroethics.

AB In recent years, the views of the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk
   about humanism and the biological self-engineering of mankind caused
   much turmoil in European intellectual circles. However, this is just one
   episode in a more general current controversy about the ethics of
   self-manipulation, a debate that often centers around the recent
   progress in genomics and the possibility of shaping human genetic
   structure. The complete sequencing of the human genome has reinforced
   this focus. Making the human genome the object of a highly visible
   world-wide research effort has reinforced popular notions stressing the
   centrality of the genome in defining individuality and humanity. As a
   result, proponents and opponents of the self-engineering of human nature
   have often concentrated on technologies related to the genome. However,
   if one compares "genome-based" and "brain-based" explanations of Self
   and behavior, it turns out that neural aspects of human nature are more
   directly relevant. Many philosophical and ethical questions
   traditionally raised about genetics and genomics acquire more relevance
   and urgency when re-examined in the context of neuroscience.

AB Humans subjects research entails significant legal and ethical
   obligations. Neuroimaging researchers must be familiar with the
   requirements of human subjects protection, including evolving standards
   for the protection of privacy and the disclosure of,risk in
   "non-therapeutic" research. Techniques for creating veridical surface
   renderings from volumetric anatomical imaging data raise new privacy
   concerns, particularly under the federal medical privacy regulation.
   Additionally, neuroimaging researchers must consider their obligation to
   communicate research results responsibly. The emerging field of
   neuroethics should strive to raise awareness of these issues and to
   involve neuroimaging researchers in the legal, ethical, and policy
   debates that currently surround human subjects research. (C) 2002
